  abstract = {Various types of deep learning architecture have been steadily gaining impetus for automatic environmental sound classification. However, the relative paucity of publicly accessible dataset hinders any further improvement in this direction. This work has two principal contributions. First, we put forward a deep learning framework employing convolutional neural network for automatic environmental sound classification. Second, we investigate the possibility of generating synthetic data using data augmentation. We suggest a novel technique for audio data augmentation using a generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed model along with data augmentation is assessed on the UrbanSound8K dataset. The results authenticate that the suggested method surpasses state-of-the-art methods for data augmentation.},

  abstract = {The work reported by Romano and Elad presents the SOS boosting - a generic recursive method for improving image denoising algorithms. Appealing properties of the SOS scheme are its flexibility to work with any denoising method, its simplicity, and its robustness. In this article we aim to generalize this to the image deblurring task. The proposed SOS procedure for deblurring is given by the following iterative steps: [S]trengthen the signal by blurring the output of the previous iteration and adding it to the blurred input image, [O]perate the deblurring algorithm on the strengthened image, and [S]ubtract the previous output from the current one. We demonstrate this procedure for several state-of-the-art methods (BM3D, EPLL and NCSR), showing the potential gain in output quality for each. As in the original SOS, we manipulate the iterative algorithm by two parameters, better controlling its steady state and rate of convergence.},

DFT-s-SEFDM systems are similar to DFT-spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) systems, yet offer improved spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the CRML detector can achieve the same bit error rate (BER) performance as the ML detector in DFT-s-SEFDM systems at reduced computational complexity. Specifically, compared to a conventional ML detector, it is shown that CRML can decrease the search region by up to 2M times where M denotes the constellation cardinality. Depending on parameter configuration, CRML can offer up to two orders of magnitude improvement in execution runtime performance. CRML is best-suited to applications with small system sizes, for example, in narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) networks.},

For the sake of concreteness, we consider an analog processing stage composed of a switching network with analog combining. The main contribution of this work consists on the proposal and evaluation of an optimization procedure based on a smart relaxation. The optimal hybrid precoder under a transmit power constraint is derived, after which, the analog precoding matrix is binarized. After an intuitive reasoning, we note that multiple solutions exist. Nevertheless, the (very) reduced computational complexity of the proposed optimization scheme makes it feasible for realistic implementations.

  abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique is expected to be extensively used in future wireless systems to increase capacity of wireless channels. Nevertheless, the capacity gain comes with a cost. In particular, multiple analog radio frequency (RF) chains are required at both the transmitter and the receiver, thereby leading to a higher implementation cost, more power consumption, and lower energy efficiency. This paper presents a receiver with only one RF chain for 2 × 2 MIMO transmission system. Proposed design is based on a time modulated antenna array (TMAA) with beam-steering functionality and a wideband software defined radio (SDR). Spatial streams were created by demultiplexing spectral components (sidebands) generated by periodical ON/OFF switching. Number of RF chains was reduced from 2 to 1 while maintaining sufficiently low correlation of spatial streams, which is required to perform MIMO transmission. Feasibility of proposed technique is evaluated by means of experimental verification.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of source enumeration by an array of sensors in the challenging conditions of: i) large uniform arrays with few snapshots, and ii) non-white or spatially correlated noises with arbitrary correlation. To solve this problem, we combine a subspace averaging (SA) technique, recently proposed for the case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noises, with a majority vote approach. The number of sources is detected for increasing dimensions of the SA technique and then a majority vote is applied to determine the final estimate. As illustrated by some simulation examples, this simple modification makes SA a very robust method of enumerating sources in these challenging scenarios.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Least-mean-square (LMS) filters are a well-studied processing technique that adapts iteratively to an unknown process. It has been proven that the parameters of the LMS filter converge to the optimum (Wiener) solution. Unfortunately, this is only possible if the adaptation steps are infinitely small. Small steps, however, result in slow convergence. The challenge is to vary the step size such that they are large, when the LMS filter coefficients are far from their optimal values and to lower the step size, when the adaptive system is approaching the optimum. State-of-the-art approaches to variable-step-size determination take estimates of the measurement noise into account for optimal performance. This paper proposes a new technique for the estimation of the measurement-noise variance, which also can deal with sudden changes of the unknown system. Based on investigations with a broad range of experimental conditions in terms of test signals and different measurement-noise levels, it is shown that the proposed estimation technique is robust to changes of the unknown system and outperforms other methods.},

  abstract = {Power usage is an important aspect of wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) and reducing the amount of information that is to be transmitted is one effective way to save it. In previous contributions, we presented sensor selection as well as rate distribution methods to reduce the power usage of beamforming algorithms in WASNs. Taking only transmission power into account, it was shown that rate distribution is a generalization of sensor selection and that rate distribution is more efficient than sensor selection with respect to the power usage versus performance trade-off. However, this excludes the energy consumption that it takes to keep the WASN nodes activated. In this paper, we present a more detailed comparison between sensor selection and rate-allocation by taking also into account the power to keep sensors activated for centralized WASNs. The framework is formulated by minimizing the total power usage, while lower bounding the noise reduction performance. Numerical results show that whether rate distribution is more efficient than sensor selection depends on the actual power that is used to keep sensors activated.},

The signal is assumed unknown deterministic and it is observed in independent and additive white Gaussian noise. Such a problem can arise when the signal to be detected obeys the linear subspace model and when it is corrupted by unknown interference. It can also be relevant in machine learning applications where one wants to check whether an assumed linear model fits the analyzed data. For this problem, where it is shown that no Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) and no UMP invariant tests exist, an AUMP invariant test is derived.},

  abstract = {The trade-off when simulating wireless cellular networks is mainly between accuracy on the one side and simulation time and supported maximum network size on the other side. A common approach in system level (SL) simulations is to utilize various abstractions that also include employing propagation models, which can be parameterized by only a small number of values. When investigating high speed train (HST) scenarios, the distinct effects of this particular environment have to be reflected in the chosen models. In order to verify the validity of SL simulations in this context, we incorporate the results of channel measurements, obtained in a real-world train transmission scenario, in our SL simulations and compare the obtained results to those of post-processed results obtained directly through the measurement data. We show that despite of the various abstraction steps in SL simulations, average throughput results are in good accordance and general trends are preserved. Additionally, we take advantage of the more flexible SL simulations and investigate the influence of feedback delay and jitter. In a last step, we then discuss the advantages of introducing a channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback backoff, in order to improve the reliability of the connection in this context.},

  abstract = {The ongoing process of automation in production lines increases the requirements for robust and reliable quality control. Acoustic quality control can play a major part in advanced quality control systems since several types of faults such as changes in machine conditions can be heard by experienced machine operators but can hardly be detected otherwise. To this day, acoustic detection systems using airborne sounds struggle due to the highly complex noise scenarios inside factories. Machine learning systems are theoretically able to cope with these conditions. However, recent advancements in the field of Industrial Sound Analysis (ISA) are sparse compared to related research fields like Music Information Retrieval (MIR) or Acoustic Event Detection (AED). One main reason is the lack of freely available datasets since most of the data is very sensitive for companies. Therefore, three novel datasets for ISA with different application fields were recorded and published along with this paper: detection of the operational state of an electric engine, detection of the surface of rolling metal balls, and detection of different bulk materials. For each dataset, neural network based baseline systems were evaluated. The results show that such systems obtain high classification accuracies over all datasets in many of the subtasks which demonstrates the feasibility of audio-based analysis of industrial analysis scenarios. However, the baseline systems remain highly sensitive to changes in the recording setup, which leaves a lot of room for improvement. The main goal of this paper is to stimulate further research in the field of ISA.},

Viewing the spherical Radon transform in this manner leads to a straightforward derivation of its spherical harmonic representation, from which we show the spherical Radon transform can be inverted exactly for signals exhibiting antipodal symmetry. We then construct a spherical ridgelet transform by composing the spherical Radon and scale-discretised wavelet transforms on the sphere. The resulting spherical ridgelet transform also admits exact inversion for antipodal signals. The restriction to antipodal signals is expected since the spherical Radon and ridgelet transforms themselves result in signals that exhibit antipodal symmetry. Our ridgelet transform is defined natively on the sphere, probes signal content globally along great circles, does not exhibit blocking artefacts, supports spin signals and exhibits an exact and explicit inverse transform. No alternative ridgelet construction on the sphere satisfies all of these properties. Our implementation of the spherical Radon and ridgelet transforms is made publicly available. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of spherical ridgelets for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of white matter fibers in the brain.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Inverse problems play a key role in modern image/signal processing methods. However, since they are generally ill-conditioned or ill-posed due to lack of observations, their solutions may have significant intrinsic uncertainty. Analysing and quantifying this uncertainty is very challenging, particularly in high-dimensional problems and problems with non-smooth objective functionals (e.g. sparsity-promoting priors). In this article, a series of strategies to visualise this uncertainty are presented, e.g. highest posterior density credible regions, and local credible intervals (cf. error bars) for individual pixels and superpixels. Our methods support non-smooth priors for inverse problems and can be scaled to high-dimensional settings. Moreover, we present strategies to automatically set regularisation parameters so that the proposed uncertainty quantification (UQ) strategies become much easier to use. Also, different kinds of dictionaries (complete and over-complete) are used to represent the image/signal and their performance in the proposed UQ methodology is investigated.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Conventional time-frequency-domain blind source separation (BSS) requires permutation alignment of the sound sources. Permutation alignment methods can be classified into two types: those that use the direction of arrival (DOA) constraints and those that model the sound source characteristics instead of DOA constraints. Multi-channel non-negative matrix factorization (MNMF), which is based on the second type, is one of the most effective BSS methods. However, our experiments revealed that its permutation alignment sometimes fails due to the lack of a DOA constraint. We present a permutation alignment method based on the DOAs directly obtained from a spatial correlation matrix by using multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and that solves the permutation problems by minimizing the discrepancy of the MUSIC spectra, which belong to the same source, in the middle of the BSS algorithm. Our proposed method boosts the second type with a help of the DOA constraint and can be applied in a blind manner to both the mixing system approach, e.g., MNMF, and the demixing system approach, e.g., independent low-rank matrix analysis. Experiments showed that the proposed method is effective for both approaches.},

  abstract = {Effective and powerful methods for denoising electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great successes but only very recently they have been used in processing ECG signals. This paper presents two DL models, together with a standard wavelet-based technique for denoising ECG signals. First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is depicted and applied to noisy ECG signals. It includes six convolutional layers, with subsequent pooling and a fully connected layer for regression. The second DL model is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, consisting of two LSTM layers. A wavelet technique based on an empirical Bayesian method with a Cauchy prior is also applied for comparison with the DL models, which are trained and tested on two synthetic datasets and a dataset containing real ECG signals. The results demonstrate that while both DL models were capable of dealing with heavy and drifting noise, the CNN model was markedly superior to the LSTM model in terms of the Root Mean Squared (RMS) error, and the wavelet technique was suitable only for rejecting random noise.},

  abstract = {Ambiguity in radar measurements is a well-studied problem, but more recent advances in multifunction phased-array radars motivate the development of disambiguation schemes that operate in a minimal amount of time. To that end, a recent work has developed a disambiguation scheme that can be optimized to minimize dwell time, but uses waveforms that may degrade the probability of false alarm and result in the masking of small targets. In this paper, we develop several waveform design methods, along with the corresponding optimization framework, for the purpose of mitigating these issues in the case where target velocity is small or known in advance. We show that while some improvement is possible with no increase in dwell time using interpulse codes, substantial improvement can be had with only a mild increase in dwell time by adding CPI separation or mismatched filters, and a perfect response can be obtained by using codes with perfect periodic autocorrelations, but with a more substantial increase in dwell time.},

  abstract = {Sparsity-inducing techniques have been introduced into direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and achieved a great success in performance. However the computational complexity of the conventional sparsity-inducing techniques is prohibitively high and thus prevents such methods from application. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity DOA estimation algorithm based on approximate message passing (AMP). Derived from the loopy belief propagation, AMP is a fast algorithm to obtain the posterior distribution of the signal. The proposed algorithm combines the AMP with expectation maximization (EM) technique to adaptively learn the hyper-parameters in the Gaussian priori of the signal. Closed-form update rule of signal prior variance is derived using fix-point method, an estimator of sources number and an empirical update rule for noise variance are also derived. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude, while obtaining comparable performance of DOA estimation. Numerical simulation demonstrates the advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {In many engineering applications, noise often exhibits strongly impulsive characteristics, while the conventional adaptive filtering (AF) algorithms are less robust to the impulsive noise. The AF algorithms based on maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) have been devised to effectively enhance the adaptive estimation performance in impulsive noise environments. In this paper, a robust group-sparse proportionate affine projection (RGS-PAP) algorithm based on MCC is proposed for estimating group-sparse channels which often occur in network echo paths and satellite communications channels. The constructed RGSPAP algorithm is derived via exerting a mixed l2,1 norm constraint of AF weights into the updating equation of the affine projection algorithm with MCC to utilize the groupsparse characteristics. The developed RGS-PAP algorithm is analyzed by setting up various simulation experiments to verify its robustness and effectiveness. Simulation results indicate that the proposed RGS-PAP algorithm provides faster convergence and lower estimation bias compared with other algorithms under various input signals in impulse noise environments.},

Application modeling has been studied extensively, whereas architecture modeling has received less attention. Originally developed for signal processing systems, Linear System Level Architecture (LSLA) is the first architecture modeling approach that clearly distinguishes the underlying computation hardware from software. Up to now, LSLA has covered the modeling of multicore CPUs. This work proposes extending the LSLA model with GPU support, by including the notion of parallelism.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the application of 2D visual object tracking in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for the coverage of live outdoor events, by filming moving targets (e.g., athletes, boats, cars etc.). In this application scenario, a 2D target tracker visually assists the UAV pilot (or cameraman) to maintain proper target framing, or it is employed for autonomous UAV operation. It should be expected that in such scenarios, the 2D tracker may fail due to target occlusions, illumination variations, fast 3D target motion, etc., thus, the 2D tracker should be able to recover from such situations. The proposed long-term 2D tracking algorithm solves exactly this problem, by detecting occlusions from the 2D tracker responses. Moreover, according to the immensity of the occlusion, the tracker may stop updating the tracker model or try to re-detect the target in a broader frame region. Experimental results indicate that our proposed tracking algorithm outperforms state-of-the art correlation filter trackers in UAV orientated visual tracking benchmarks, as well as in realistic UAV cinematography applications.},

Conventional WaveNet-based neural vocoding systems significantly improve the perceptual quality of synthesized speech by statistically generating a time sequence of speech waveforms through an auto-regressive framework. However, they often suffer from noisy outputs because of the difficulties in capturing the complicated time-varying nature of speech signals. To improve modeling efficiency, the proposed ExcitNet vocoder employs an adaptive inverse filter to decouple spectral components from the speech signal. The residual component, i.e. excitation signal, is then trained and generated within the WaveNet framework. In this way, the quality of the synthesized speech signal can be further improved since the spectral component is well represented by a deep learning framework and, moreover, the residual component is efficiently generated by the WaveNet framework. Experimental results show that the proposed ExcitNet vocoder, trained both speaker-dependently and speaker-independently, outperforms traditional linear prediction vocoders and similarly configured conventional WaveNet vocoders.},

An argument against those methods is that the WGN assumption is not valid in many real acoustic scenarios. To take into account the coloured nature of the noise, a pre-whitening filter which renders the background noise closer to white can be applied. This paper introduces an adaptive pre-whitener based on a supervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), in which a pre-trained dictionary includes parametrized spectral information about the noise and speech sources in the form of autoregressive (AR) coefficients. Results show that the noise can get closer to white, in comparison to pre-whiteners based on conventional noise power spectral density (PSD) estimates such as minimum statistics and MMSE. A better pitch estimation accuracy can be achieved as well. Speech enhancement based on the WGN assumption shows a similar performance to the conventional enhancement which makes use of the background noise PSD estimate, which reveals that the proposed pre-whitener can preserve the signal of interest.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Point clouds provide an efficient way of representing 3D data for applications such as virtual or augmented reality, free-viewpoint video, and gaming. However, this rich, realistic and immersive representation demands a very high amount of data and thus efficient point cloud coding solutions are increasingly needed. A promising way to represent point clouds is through octree partitioning, which provides good compression performance with low complexity, as well as level-of-detail scalability. However, other data representations may offer additional benefits to the octree data structure. The goal of this paper is to propose a point cloud geometry coding solution that leverages the adaptive octree partitioning, and enhances it with a novel coding mode. This mode exploits a plane representation for leaf nodes at different layers of the octree. This corresponds to a hybrid solution where two point cloud representation models are combined. The proposed approach can outperform octree based solutions that are currently considered for standardization and it also provides significant compression gains against a static octree solution (average BD-rate gains of 35% are reported).},

  abstract = {In various applications within signal processing, system identification, pattern recognition, and scientific computing, the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a higher-order tensor is only known via general linear measurements. In this paper, we show that the computation of such a CPD can be reformulated as a sum of CPDs with linearly constrained factor matrices by assuming that the measurement matrix can be approximated by a sum of a (small) number of Kronecker products. By properly exploiting the hypothesized structure, we can derive an efficient non-linear least squares algorithm, allowing us to tackle large-scale problems.},

  pages = {1-4},
  abstract = {State-of-the-art compression schemes generally have the ability to adapt themselves to the properties of the data to be compressed. This is a kind of learning process and requires the modification of internal variables influencing the treatment of subsequent data segments. In other words: the order of processing has an impact on the compression performance. In image compression, the order can be changed, for example, by rotating the input image by 90°, 180°, or 270°. In application to lossless screen content compression, investigations with different compression schemes (LOCO-I, HEVC, FP8v3, and SCF) have shown that the rotation has a considerable impact on the compression performance. The difficulty, however, is to predict the best rotation. For the SCF (soft context formation) compression scheme, we have developed a method based on a tiny neural network that suggests a suitable rotation by evaluating basic colour properties of the image to be compressed. The compression can be improved by 0.7098% to 1.3817% depending on the image set tested.},

  abstract = {The centralized control for multi-channel active noise control (ANC) systems usually cost considerable processing power due to the transfer functions between a large number of loudspeakers and error microphones; while the decentralized control has the increased risk of global instability. Distribution of the controller network could save computational burden while maintaining satisfactory performance. A lot of ANC algorithms employing diffusion control have been proposed recently. The communication within diffusion networks introduces the estimation bias of each controller and makes it difficult to analyze the performance of the entire system. This paper analyzes the performance of the diffusion ANC network based on a family of diffusion filtered-x (Fx) algorithms employing either the single- or multiple-measurement. Difference equations describing the mean and mean squares convergence behaviors of these ANC systems are derived to characterize its optimal solution, estimation bias and variance. Simulations have been conducted to compare the performance of diffusion Fx algorithms and the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.},

  title = {Low Complexity Robust Adaptive Beamformer Based On Parallel RLMS and Kalman RLMS},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {To ease spectral congestion and enhance frequency reuse, researchers are targeting smart antenna systems using spatial multiplexing and adaptive signal processing techniques. Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of such systems is highly dependent on the adaptive algorithms they employ. A popular, adaptive beamforming algorithm, widely used in smart antennas, is the Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. While, the classical RLS implementation achieves high convergence, it still suffers from its inability to track the target of interest. Recently, a new adaptive algorithm called Recursive Least Square - Least Mean Square (RLMS) which employs a RLS stage followed by a Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm stage and separated by an estimate of the array image vector, i.e. steering vector, has been proposed. RLMS outperforms previous RLS and LMS variants, with superior convergence and tracking capabilities, at the cost of a moderate increase in computational complexity. In this paper, an enhanced, low complexity parallel version of the cascade RLMS is presented by eliminating the need for computing the array image vector cascading stage. Hence, For an antenna of N elements our strategy can reduce the complexity of the system by 20N multiplications, 6N additions and 2N divisions. Moreover, a new Kalman based parallel RLMS (RKLMS) method is also proposed, where the LMS stage is replaced by a Kalman implementation of the classical LMS, and compared under low Signal to Interference plus Noise ratios (SINR). Simulation results show identical performance for the parallel RLMS, cascaded RLMS at 10dB and superior performance and robustness for the RKLMS on low SINR cases up to -10dB.},

  abstract = {Adaptive filter theory for supervised identification of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is an established and fruitful discipline in digital signal processing. In certain applications, however, the input and output signals of an LTI system may be asynchronously sampled at slightly different sampling frequencies resulting in a small input-output sampling rate offset (IO-SRO). In this contribution, we argue that an LTI system with IO-SRO is seen as a linear time-variant system by the adaptive filter. By conducting a convergence-in-the-mean analysis, we propose a model to capture the influence of IO-SRO on the tracking properties of the adaptive filter. Eventually, we validate our model by reconstruction of the IO-SRO based on the proposed model and the observable adaptive filter behavior. The model-based IO-SRO reconstruction turns out to be highly precise and robust against noise and excitation bandwidth limitations when compared to a state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract = {Estimating time-frequency domain masks for speech enhancement using deep learning approaches has recently become a popular field of research. In this paper, we propose a mask-based speech enhancement framework by using concatenated identical deep neural networks (CI-DNNs). The idea is that a single DNN is trained under multiple input and output signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) conditions, using targets that provide a moderate SNR gain with respect to the input and therefore achieve a balance between speech component quality and noise suppression. We concatenate this single DNN several times without any retraining to provide enough noise attenuation. Simulation results show that our proposed CI-DNN outperforms enhancement methods using classical spectral weighting rules w.r.t. total speech quality and speech intelligibility. Moreover, our approach shows similar or even a little bit better performance with much fewer trainable parameters compared with a noisy-target single DNN approach of the same size. A comparison to the conventional clean-target single DNN approach shows that our proposed CI-DNN is better in speech component quality and much better in residual noise component quality. Most importantly, our new CI-DNN generalized best to an unseen noise type, if compared to the other tested deep learning approaches.},

  abstract = {Heavy machine tools are used in numerous industrial manufacturing processes. Avoiding unplanned maintenance time is crucial and can be achieved by continuous condition monitoring. A more targeted condition monitoring is possible if the operating state of a machine tool is known (e.g. standstill, neutral or cut). However, many manufacturers of control units do not release any information about the machine's operating state. For this reason, we investigated a system-independent approach to determine the operating state in real-time in less than 1 ms. This low runtime is necessary for machine state classification. Since most machine tools vary in individual components, the proposed state detection uses learning algorithms based on the machine's vibration characteristics. In this work we propose the Random Forest algorithm because of its reliable classification performance while keeping explainability of each prediction. Facing the real-time requirements, the Random Forest model has been adapted to an embedded device with very limited resources. Thus, the model prediction has to work with low resource consumption in a very low runtime and without loss in accuracy. We show that this approach is suitable for determining machine operating states in real-time in less than 700 μs with an average accuracy of 96 %.},

  abstract = {Estimating the quality of speech without the use of a clean reference signal is a challenging problem, in part due to the time and expense required to collect sufficient training data for modern machine learning algorithms. We present a novel, non-intrusive estimator that exploits recurrent neural network architectures to predict the intrusive POLQA score of a speech signal in a short time context. The predictor is based on a novel compressed representation of modulation domain features, used in conjunction with static MFCC features. We show that the proposed method can reliably predict POLQA with a 300 ms context, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.21 on unseen data. The proposed method is trained using English speech and is shown to generalize well across unseen languages. The neural network also jointly estimates the mean voice activity detection (VAD) with an F1 accuracy score of 0.9, removing the need for an external VAD.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The FISTA (fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm) is a well-known and fast (theoretical O(k-2) rate of convergence) procedure for solving optimization problems composed by the sum of two convex functions, such that one is smooth (differentiable) and the other is possible nonsmooth. FISTA can be understood as a first order method with one important aspect: it uses a suitable extragradient rule, i.e.: the gradient is evaluated at a linear combination of the past two iterates, whose weights, are usually referred to as the inertial sequence. While problem dependent, it has a direct impact on the FISTA's practical computational performance. In this paper we propose a novel inertial sequence; when compared to well-established alternative choices, in the context of convolutional sparse coding and Wavelet-based inpainting, our proposed inertial sequence can reduce the number of FISTA's global iterations (and thus overall computational time) by 30% ~ 50% to attain the same level of reduction in the cost functional.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Many real systems have inherently some type of sparsity. Recently, the feature least-mean square (F-LMS) has been proposed to exploit hidden sparsity. Unlike the existing algorithms, the F-LMS algorithm performs a linear combination of the adaptive coefficients to reveal and then exploit the hidden sparsity. However, many systems have also plain besides hidden sparsity, and the F-LMS algorithm is not able to exploit the former. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named simple sparsity-aware F-LMS (SSF-LMS) algorithm, that is capable of exploiting both kinds of sparsity simultaneously. The hidden sparsity is exploited just like in the F-LMS algorithm, whereas the plain sparsity is exploited by means of the discard function applied to the filter coefficients. By doing so, the proposed SSFLMS algorithm not only outperforms the F-LMS algorithm when plain sparsity is also observed, but also requires fewer arithmetic operations. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm has faster speed of convergence and reaches lower steady-state mean-squared error (MSE) than the F-LMS and classical algorithms, when the system has plain and hidden sparsity.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a closed-form solution with reduced bias for differential received signal strength (DRSS) localization. During the linearization of DRSS measurement equations, the measurement noise is injected into the measurement data matrix, resulting in a correlation between the measurement noise and measurement data matrix. Existing closed-form solutions do not consider this correlation, which causes biased estimation results. The solution proposed here aims to eliminate the bias by introducing instrument variables (IV), whose role is to mitigate the correlation arising from linearization. Simulation results demonstrate the improved performance of the IV-based estimator over some existing closed-form solutions, in the form of root-mean-squared errors that are close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound, and significantly reduced bias, over a wide range of noise levels.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {An effective fast SKIP mode decision method is proposed for the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoding. In order to determine the best Prediction Unit (PU) mode for a given Coding Unit (CU), the reference software for HEVC checks every PU mode candidate. This causes enormous computational complexity, especially in HEVC inter coding, which should be tackled for a fast encoder. An algorithm is proposed which exploits the fact that the SKIP mode can be directly decided as an optimal PU mode when reconstructed CUs of all candidates are similar. This is because bits for the SKIP mode is pretty small compared to other candidates. Thus, the distortion value between reconstructed CUs in 2N × 2N Merge and SKIP mode is measured in terms of the Human Visual System (HVS). If it is determined as unnoticeable, then a given CU is encoded in the SKIP mode. Experimental results show that the proposed method can save encoding time by 48.11 % and 41.66 % on average with minor objective quality losses under the Random Access (RA) and Low Delay (LD)-B configurations respectively.},

  abstract = {Multifractal analysis has become a standard signal processing tool successfully used to model scale-free temporal dynamics in many applications, very different in nature. This is notably the case in financial engineering where, after Mandelbrot's seminal contributions, multifractal models have been used since the late 90ies to describe temporal fluctuations in asset prices. However, what exact features of temporal dynamics are actually encoded in multifractal properties remains generally only partially understood. In finance, notably, multifractality is associated to the burstiness of the returns, yet its relation to trends (signs of the returns) or volatility (modulus of the returns) remains unclear. Comparing the estimated multifractal properties of well-controlled synthetic multifractal processes to those of surrogate data, obtained by applying random permutations (shuffling) either to signs, or to modulus, or to both, of increments of original data, permits to better understand what aspects of temporal dynamics are captured by multifractality. The same procedure applied to a large dataset of asset prices entering the composition of the Eurostoxx600 index permits to evidence a simple and solid relation between multifractality and volatility as well as a weaker and complicated relation to returns.},

  abstract = {The evolution of Industry towards the 4.0 paradigm has motivated the adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to deal with applications where predictive and maintenance tasks are performed. These tasks become difficult to carry out when rare events are present due to the imbalance of data. This is because training of ANN can be biased. Conventional techniques addressing this problem are mainly based on resampling-based approaches. However, these are not always feasible when dealing with time-series forecasting tasks in industrial scenarios. For that reason, this work proposes the application of data preprocessing techniques especially designed to face this scenario, a problem which has not been covered enough in the state-of-the-art. Considered techniques are applied over time-series data coming from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). Our proposal significantly outperforms current strategies showing a 68% of improvement in terms of RMSE when rare events are addressed.},

The NN NLOS detector is able to take care of a variable number of NLOS measurements while the IWSON handles naturally a variable number of inputs and yields a solution without explicitly solving the nonlinear estimation problem. Simulations validate the good performance of the system with a different number of NLOS measurements.

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Acoustic echo cancellation and system identification in reverberant environments have been thoroughly studied in the literature. Theoretically, in a reverberant environment the Acoustic Impulse Response (AIR) relating the loudspeaker signal, denoted reference, with the corresponding signal component at the microphone, denoted echo, is of an infinite length and can be modeled as an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. Correspondingly, the echo signal can be modeled as an Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process. Yet, most methods for this problem adopt a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) system model or equivalently a Moving Average (MA) echo signal model due to their favorable simplicity and stability. Latter methods, denoted FIR-Acoustic Echo Canceller (AEC), employ an Adaptive Filter (AF) for tracking a possibly time-varying system and cancelling echo. Some contributions adopt an IIR system model and utilize it to derive a time-domain AEC and accurately analyze the room behaviour. An IIR system model has also been successfully applied in the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) domain for the dereverberation problem.In this contribution we consider an IIR model in the STFT domain and propose a novel online AEC algorithm, denoted IIR-AEC, which tracks the model parameters and cancels echo. The order of the feed-back filter, equivalent to the order of the Auto Regressive (AR) part of the echo signal model, can be designed to fit the acoustic model and the order of the feed-forward filter, equivalent to the order of the MA part of the echo signal model, is limited to a single tap, thereby requiring that the STFT window is longer than the early part of the AIR. The computational complexity of proposed IIR-AEC is comparable to a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) implementation of FIRAEC. These methods are evaluated using real measured AIRs drawn from a recording campaign and the IIR-AEC is shown to outperform the FIR-AEC.},

  abstract = {In this paper, target detection is studied for a cloud multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system, where each receiver communicates with a fusion center (FC) through a backhaul network. To reduce communication burden, local measurements at each receiver are quantized before they are sent to the FC. Under a bitrate constraint for each local sensor, we derive the detection probability of the cloud radar and analyze effects of the sampling rate and bits per sample on the detection performance. The quantizer output is initially modeled using direct analysis (DA), and then the Gaussian quantization error approximation (GQEA) method is employed to facilitate theoretical analysis. We verify that these two methods lead to close enough detection performance for large enough number of bits per sample. The tradeoff between the sampling rate and bits per sample is presented analytically and numerically.},

We use vocoder parameters for acoustic modelling, to separate the influence of pitch and timbre. This facilitates the modelling of the large variability of pitch in the singing voice. Our network takes a block of consecutive frame-wise linguistic and fundamental frequency features, along with global singer identity as input and outputs vocoder features, corresponding to the block of features. This block-wise approach, along with the training methodology allows us to model temporal dependencies within the features of the input block. For inference, sequential blocks are concatenated using an overlap-add procedure. We show that the performance of our model is competitive with regards to the state-of-the-art and the original sample using objective metrics and a subjective listening test.

In particular, these methods are splitted in two categories, which we refer to as likelihood-based methods and fingerprinting methods. Then, we provide a novel geolocation approach in each of these two categories. The first proposed technique relies on a semi-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimator of the likelihood, followed by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of the object's position. The second technique consists in learning a proper metric on the dataset, constructed by means of a Gradient boosting regressor: a k-nearest neighbor algorithm is then used to estimate the position. Finally, all the proposed methods are compared on a data set originated from Sigfox network. The experiments show the interest of the proposed methods, both in terms of location estimation performance, and of ability to build radio maps.},

Given a reference channel (RC) and a surveillance channel (SC), the goal is to detect a target echo present at the surveillance array transmitted by an illuminator of opportunity equipped with multiple antennas. Since common transmission signals are cyclostationary, we exploit this information at the detector. Specifically, we derive an asymptotic generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to detect the presence of a cyclostationary signal at the SC given observations from RC and SC. This detector tests for different covariance structures. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed detector compared to competing techniques that do not exploit cyclostationarity.},

The proposed optimization algorithm is designed as a gradient descent type scheme for the composite of the original cost function and the inverse of the localized Cayley transform defined on the vector space of all skew-symmetric matrices. Thanks to the adaptive localized Cayley transform which is a computable diffeomorphism between the orthogonal group and the vector space of the skew-symmetric matrices, the proposed algorithm (i) is free from the singularity issue, which can cause performance degradation, observed in the dual Cayley parametrization technique [Yamada- Ezaki'03] as well as (ii) can enjoy powerful arts for acceleration on the vector space without suffering from the nonlinear nature of the Stiefel manifold. We also present a convergence analysis, for the prototype algorithm employing the Armijo's rule, that shows the gradient of the composite function at zero in the range space of the localized Cayley transform is guaranteed to converge to zero. Numerical experiments show excellent performance compared with major optimization algorithms designed essentially with retractions on the tangent space of the Stiefel manifold [Absil-Mahony-Sepulcher'08, Wen-Yin'13].},

Weighted least squares (WLS) and Semidefinite programming (SDP) are two research directions for solving this problem. However, existing studies can not provide a high-quality solution over a large range of measurements noise.

  abstract = {Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a type of abnormal heart rhythm which may lead to a stroke or cardiac arrest. In spite of numerous research works, developing an automatic mechanism for accurate detection of AF remains a popular yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture for classification of AF using single-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of short duration. We define a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) structure, comprising two Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal analysis of RR intervals and PR intervals in an ECG recording. Output states of the two LSTMs are merged at the dense layer along with a set of hand-crafted statistical features, related to the measurement of heart rate variability (HRV). The proposed architecture is proven on the open access PhysioNet Challenge 2017 dataset, containing more than 8500 single-lead ECG recordings. Results show that our methodology yields sensitivity of 0.93, specificity of 0.98 and F1-score of 0.89 in classifying AF, which is better than the existing accuracy scores, reported on the dataset.},

Human gaze, as a sub-conscious response, is influenced from several factors related to the human mental activity. Several studies have so far proposed methodologies based on the use of gaze statistical modeling and naive classifiers for assessing images or image patches as relevant or not to the user's interests. Nevertheless, the outstanding majority of literature approaches only relied so far on the use of handcrafted features and relative simple classification schemes. On the contrary, the current work focuses on the use of DL schemes that will enable the modeling of complex patterns in the captured gaze signal and the subsequent derivation of corresponding discriminant features. Novel contributions of this study include: a) the introduction of a large-scale annotated gaze dataset, suitable for training DL models, b) a novel method for gaze modeling, capable of handling gaze sensor errors, and c) a DL based method, able to capture gaze patterns for assessing image objects as relevant or non-relevant, with respect to the user's preferences.

  abstract = {Previous work in 3D human action recognition has been mainly confined to schemes in a single domain, exploiting in principle skeleton-tracking data, due to their compact representation and efficient modeling of the observed motion dynamics. However, in order to extend and adapt the learning process to multi-modal domains, inevitably the focus needs also to be put on cross-domain analysis. On the other hand, attention schemes, which have lately been applied to numerous application cases and exhibited promising results, can exploit the intra-affinity of the considered modalities and can then be used for performing intra-modality knowledge transfer, e.g. to transfer domain-specific knowledge of the skeleton modality to the flow one and vice verca. This study investigates novel cross-modal attention-based strategies to efficiently model global contextual information regarding the action dynamics, aiming to contribute towards increased overall recognition performance. In particular, a new methodology for transferring knowledge across domains is introduced, by taking advantage of the increased temporal modeling capabilities of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. Additionally, extensive experiments and thorough comparative evaluation provide a detailed analysis of the problem at hand and demonstrate the particular characteristics of the involved attention-enhanced schemes. The overall proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the currently most challenging public dataset, namely the NTU RGB-D one, surpassing similar uni/multi-modal representation schemes.},

The reduction algorithm is based on the variational maximum mutual information (VMMI) method, which in contrast to other reduction algorithms, requires only the parameters of existing high order and high dimensional mixture models. The idea behind the proposed approach, called JVC-VMMI (for joint vector and component VMMI), differs significantly from traditional classification approaches that perform separately dimensionality reduction first, and then use the low-dimensional feature vector for training lower order models. The fact that the JVC-VMMI approach is relieved from using the original data samples admits an extremely efficient computation of the reduced models optimized for the classification task. We report experiments in vowel classification in which JVC-VMMI outperformed conventional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) dimensionality reduction methods.},

  abstract = {Modern railway transportation systems need a reliable communication infrastructure providing very high data rates and low latencies for applications such as communications-based train control (CBTC) or video surveillance. In this paper, the suitability of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard for subway environments is evaluated using a propagation model based on real channel measurements. An LTE deployment with several subway stations is simulated using the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator to evaluate both the system performance and the fulfillment of the quality of service (QoS) requirements of representative services such as CBTC, closed-circuit television (CCTV), voice over IP (VoIP) and file transfer. Several parameters and procedures of the LTE system are adapted to the subway environment: the LTE network is configured using a QoS-aware scheduler, hence critical services are prioritized; the handover procedure is tuned to avoid ping-pong effects; and inter-cell interference coordination techniques are also applied.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The multi-frame Wiener filter (MFWF) for single-microphone speech enhancement is able to exploit speech correlation across consecutive time-frames in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. To achieve a high speech correlation, typically an STFT with a high time-resolution but a low frequency-resolution is applied. The MFWF can be decomposed into a multi-frame minimum power distortionless response (MFMPDR) filter and a single-frame Wiener postfilter. To implement the MFWF using this decomposition, estimates of several parameters are required, namely the speech correlation vector, the noisy speech correlation matrix, and the power spectral densities at the output of the MFMPDR filter. Correlations can be estimated either directly in the low frequency-resolution STFT filterbank, indirectly by estimating periodograms in a high frequency-resolution filterbank and applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, or in a combined way. In this paper, we compare the performance of different estimators for the required parameters. Experimental results for different speech material, noise conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios show that using a combined estimator for the speech correlation vector yields the best results in terms of speech quality compared to existing direct and indirect estimators.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have had great success in many machine vision as well as machine audition tasks. Many image recognition network architectures have consequently been adapted for audio processing tasks. However, despite some successes, the performance of many of these did not translate from the image to the audio domain. For example, very deep architectures such as ResNet [1] and DenseNet [2], which significantly outperform VGG [3] in image recognition, do not perform better in audio processing tasks such as Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC). In this paper, we investigate the reasons why such powerful architectures perform worse in ASC compared to simpler models (e.g., VGG). To this end, we analyse the receptive field (RF) of these CNNs and demonstrate the importance of the RF to the generalization capability of the models. Using our receptive field analysis, we adapt both ResNet and DenseNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance and eventually outperforming the VGG-based models. We introduce systematic ways of adapting the RF in CNNs, and present results on three data sets that show how changing the RF over the time and frequency dimensions affects a model's performance. Our experimental results show that very small or very large RFs can cause performance degradation, but deep models can be made to generalize well by carefully choosing an appropriate RF size within a certain range.},

To address this privacy issue in the context of the distributed average consensus problem, we propose a general, yet simple solution that achieves privacy using additive secret sharing, a tool from secure multiparty computation. This method enables each node to reach the consensus accurately and obtains perfect security at the same time. Unlike differential privacy based approaches, there is no trade-off between privacy and accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method is computationally simple compared to other techniques in secure multiparty computation, and it is able to achieve perfect security of any honest node as long as it has one honest neighbour under the honest-but-curious model, without any trusted third party.},

  abstract = {Average consensus is widely used in information fusion, and it requires information exchange between a set of nodes to achieve an agreement. Unfortunately, the information exchange may disclose the individual's private information, and this raises serious concerns for individual privacy in some applications. Hence, a privacy-preserving asynchronous averaging algorithm is proposed in this paper to maintain the privacy of each individual using Shamir's secret sharing scheme, as known from secure multiparty computation. The proposed algorithm is based on a lightweight cryptographic technique. It gives identical accuracy solution as the non-privacy concerned algorithm and achieves perfect security in clique-based networks without the use of a trusted third party. In each iteration of the algorithm, each individual's privacy in the selected clique is protected under a passive attack where the adversary controls some of the nodes. Finally, it also achieves robustness of up to one third transmission error.},

  abstract = {Different endocrine roles of cardiac adipose tissues motivate the analysis of their volumes and compositions on large cohort image data sets. This, however, demands reliable robust methods for automated segmentations as manual segmentations are tedious costly and unreproducible. Besides the effects of noise and partial volumes, segmentation of these adipose tissues on clinical medical images is challenged by their similar intensities and features and undetectability of their boundaries. In this paper, we present a feature- and prior-based random walker graph that additionally incorporates a diffusion-based susceptible infected recovered model to guide the segmentation by the curvatures of the surface of the segmented cardiac structures. This method is trained and evaluated for segmenting epicardial, pericardial, and perivascular adipose tissues on volumetric fat-water magnetic resonance images. The obtained results demonstrate its utility for large cohort investigation of these adipose compartments and also any other segmentation task on multichannel images.},

  abstract = {Learning redundant dictionaries for sparse representation from sets of patches has proven its efficiency in solving inverse problems. However, the optimization process often calls for the prior knowledge of the noise level or the regularization parameters for sparse encoding. In a Bayesian framework, these parameters are integrated within the probabilistic model through the choice of prior distributions. Although efficient, these methods come with numerical disadvantages for large-scale data. Small-variance asymptotic (SVA) approaches pave the way to much cheaper though approximate methods for inference by taking advantage from a fruitful interaction between Bayesian models and optimization algorithms. We propose such a SVA analysis of a Bayesian dictionary learning (DL) model where the noise level and regularization level are jointly estimated so that nearly no parameter tuning is needed. We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency on real data to illustrate the relevance of the resulting dictionaries.},

The present study uses time and frequency axes for the classification using synthesized Local Field Potential (LFP) data. The results are analyzed and compared with the FFT technique. In all the results, the CNN outperforms the FFT by a significant margin especially when the noise level is high.

  abstract = {This paper describes a procedure for Angles-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation for a uniform linear array (ULA) with missing sensors. The novelty of the approach is that, rather than using AoA estimates obtained from contiguous subarrays, we use estimates for the corresponding signal subspaces. The report shows that the ESPRIT invariance equations for each contiguous subarray define an operator that “propagates” the signal subspace beyond the physical array. Care needs to be taken to ensure the same bases are used for each subarray. The estimates of the signal subspaces for the missing array elements are appropriately combined to yield an estimate of the signal subspace for the complete ULA. The paper only addressed the case of one missing sensor, but the approach can be readily generalised. Simulations show that the proposed method yields AoA estimates which are very close to those obtained if there was no missing sensor, in contrast to the case where the measurements from the missing sensor were zero. In order to appropriately combine the estimates for the missing signal subspace terms, the report assessed the accuracy of signal subspace estimation as a function of the number N of ULA elements. Simulations indicate that, in the examples considered, the variance of these estimates decreases only as N1/3 which is surprising given that the variance of AoA estimates (at least for one source) decrease as N3. The paper suggests that further study of this empirical result is warranted.},

Current state-of-the-art combines a constellation of light-emitting diodes on controllers with a stereo pair of cameras on the head-mounted display (HMD) to track pose. These vision-based systems are unable to track controllers when they move out of the camera's field-of-view (out-of-FOV). To overcome this limitation, we employ sensor fusion and a learning-based model. Specifically, we employ ultrasound sensors on the HMD and controllers to obtain ranging information. We combine this information with predictions from an auto-regressive forecasting model that is built with a recurrent neural network. The combination is achieved via a Kalman filter across different positional states (including out-of-FOV). With the proposed approach, we demonstrate near-isotropic accuracy levels (~1.23 cm error) in estimating controller position, which was not possible to achieve before with camera-alone tracking.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Blind inverse filtering using multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP) in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain is an effective means to enhance reverberant speech. Traditionally, a speech power spectral density (PSD) weighted prediction error (WPE) minimization approach is used to estimate the prediction filters, independently in each frequency bin. The method is sensitive to the estimation of desired signal PSD. In this paper, we propose an auto-encoder (AE) deep neural network (DNN) based constraint for the estimation of desired signal PSD. An auto encoder trained on clean speech STFT coefficients is used as the prior to non-linearly map the natural speech PSD. We explore two different architectures for the auto-encoder: (i) fully-connected (FC) feed-forward, and (ii) recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. Experiments using real room impulse responses show that the LSTM-DNN based PSD estimate performs better than the traditional methods for reverberant signal enhancement.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of transmit signal design for target localization in a frequency diverse array (FDA) radar. For this purpose, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for target localization in FDA radar. The derived CRB is optimized with respect to the transmit signal parameters. It is commonly assumed that in radar systems the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation accuracy and resolution are determined by the transmit-receive array aperture. In FDA radar, a coupling between range and DOA estimation is generated. Using the derived CRB, we show that in FDA radar one is able to improve the DOA estimation accuracy and resolution by increasing the transmit signal bandwidth. The target localization performance is analyzed theoretically and via simulations, and it is shown that using the proposed approach for transmit signal optimization, results in superior target localization performance compared to conventional methods.},

This method is specifically designed to run on the stochastic machines (SM) that we are currently developing to perform efficient low-level sensor signal processing with ultra-low power consumption. The proposed SSL method is divided into two main parts. First, a probabilistic model is run on 50 very short time frames (3. 75ms each) of multichannel recorded signals. Second, the results obtained on the different frames are fused to obtain a final localization map. Using the system in a supervised way allows to extract estimated source locations by selecting as many maxima as there are sources in the room. We explain how this method is implemented on a SM. Experiments are presented to illustrate the performance and robustness of the resulting system.},

In recent works, nonsingular EB-ESPRIT methods have been proposed which can estimate the source DOA-vectors without ambiguities. In another recent publication, a subspace based pseudointensity-vector method (SS-PIV) has been proposed for DOA estimation. In this work, we derive the mathematical relation between the DOA-vector EB-ESPRIT and the SS-PIV method. We show that the SS-PIV can be seen as a special case of the DOA-vector EB-ESPRIT. Using this relation, we propose a novel DOA-estimator denoted as extended pseudointensity-vector (PIV). In the evaluation, we compare the DOA-vector EB-ESPRIT and the extended PIV with the SS-PIV and PIV under noisy and reverberant conditions.},

These approximations should consist of a specified number of segments (samples) and minimise the mean squared error to the original signal. We formalise this goal as a discrete nonconvex optimisation problem, for which we study two algorithms. First we reformulate a recent adaptive sampling method by Dar and Bruckstein in a compact and transparent way. This allows us to analyse its limitations when it comes to violations of its three key assumptions: signal smoothness, local linearity, and error balancing. As a remedy, we propose a direct optimisation approach which does not rely on any of these assumptions and employs a particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Our experiments show that for nonsmooth signals or low sample numbers, the direct optimisation approach offers substantial qualitative advantages over the Dar-Bruckstein method. As a more general contribution, we disprove the optimality of the principle of error balancing for optimising data in the ℓ2 norm.},

Therefore, both non-local information by the examples search and local information by the adaptive prediction are used together in the probability modeling.

This is especially important for scenarios where the functional form of the underlying nonlinear distortion is time-varying and/or is unknown, e.g., nonlinear distortions that vary with the volume level of the loudspeakers. To this end, the proposed method evaluates the model probabilities, or what is known as the evidence density, in a Bayesian manner. Thus, unlike convex and affine combination schemes of adaptive filters, the proposed method optimizes both the model complexity as well as the model performance by a single criterion. Moreover, by using the significance-aware principle, the proposed framework is realized in a computationally efficient way. The method is validated by three experiments using synthesized time-invariant nonlinearities, synthesized time-varying nonlinearities, and using real recorded nonlinearities.},

The algorithm separately tracks the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the incoming signal with respect to microphone pairs based on the phase in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bins. The direction of arrival (DOA) of the drone is determined by forming a solution curve corresponding to each TDOA, then clustering the curve intersections. The algorithm avoids the computationally expensive grid-search over DOA, so is significantly more efficient than beamforming. The proposed algorithm and the maximum likelihood (ML) processor (beamformer) are compared in simulated and real data scenarios. Using simulated data, the ML estimator is shown to agree with the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the proposed algorithm is shown to approach the performance of ML at higher SNR. In real data scenarios, the phase-based algorithm implemented with simple alpha-beta TDOA trackers consistently tracked the target through difficult maneuvers at short and long range, showing no degradation with respect to the beamformer. Other potential advantages include robustness against interference and ability to create phase-based spectrograms for classification.},

Typical examples include brain activity supported by neurons, data shared by users of social media, and traffic on transportation or energy networks. There are often settings where the graph is not readily available, and has to be estimated from data. This paper focuses on estimating a network structure capturing the dependencies among streaming graph signals in the form of a possibly directed, weighted adjacency matrix. Several works proposed centralized offline solutions to address this problem, without paying much attention to the distributed nature of networks. We start from a centralized setting and show how, by introducing a simple yet powerful data model, we can infer a graph structure from streaming data with a distributed online learning algorithm. Our algorithm is tested experimentally to illustrate its usefulness, and successfully compared to a centralized offline solution of the literature.},

  title = {Automated forensic ink determination in handwritten documents by clustering},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Even in today`s highly digitalized world, the use of handwriting is still widely in use for legal documents such as testaments, contracts, bank cheques or professional certificates. Thus, forgery analysis of handwriting still poses challenges for criminalistics forensic document examiners and one of the investigation questions is, if a questioned document has been written with more than one ink. If so, this may indicate a forgery by manipulations of a possible counterfeiter after production of the genuine original. By means of chemical analysis, it is possible today to identify an ink with almost 100% certainty. However, this process is manual, tedious and needs an initial suspicion by a human expert, that more than one ink was applied on a specific area on the document. Further, most chemical approaches are destructive and limited to very small areas. To improve and to automate the initial investigation on the use of multiple inks, this work proposes a pattern recognition approach based on signal processing, feature extraction and classification by data clustering, which is based on spectral imaging, acquired in almost non-destructive and contact-less manner. The goal is to support forensic examiners by an automated digital detection of regions, which have been written using different ink, which they then can further examine. For experimental evaluation, a benchmark is introduced to evaluate the accuracy of detection results on a specifically created test set, which is also presented. Test results indicate that the best clustering in our investigation has been achieved by the expectation maximisation (EM) approach, with a correct ink cover rate of above 80% for the first and 73% for the second ink in average. Even more relevant for forensic experts is the observation, that false detections occurred in less than 1% of the cases in average. Future work will include extension of data sets and automatic analysis and parameter adjustments in the clustering process.},

  abstract = {Robust subspace tracking is crucial when dealing with data in the presence of both outliers and missing observations. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, namely PETRELS-ADMM, to improve performance of subspace tracking in such scenarios. Outliers residing in the observed data are first detected in an efficient way and removed by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solver. The underlying subspace is then updated by the algorithm of parallel estimation and tracking by recursive least squares (PETRELS) in which each row of the subspace matrix was estimated in parallel. Based on PETRELS-ADMM, we also derive an efficient way for robust matrix completion. Performance studies show the superiority of PETRELS-ADMM as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. We also illustrate its effectiveness for the application of background-foreground separation.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The removal of baseline wander from the electrocardiogram does not always correct the isoelectric level of the signal. That is, to enforce reference points for amplitude measurements to 0 volt. In this work new parameters and a modified clustering method is proposed to find the isoelectric bias, which is the amplitude difference between the reference point and 0 volt prior to the isoelectric correction. Validation with old parameters and previous iteration of the clustering method are also performed on the QT database from PhysioNet. Both methods are viable to find the isoelectric bias in the PQ-segment. 3 assessment criteria are used. The first criterion (A) is based on the location of the isoelectric bias with respect to the PQ-segment. The second criterion (B) is based on the absolute difference between the isoelectric bias and median amplitude of the PQ-segment. And the third criterion (C) is the mean and standard deviation of the absolute difference between the isoelectric bias and median amplitude of the PQ-segment.Best results are obtained with the new proposed method with a probability of true detection (PD) of 99.62 pct (A), PD of 98.40 pct (B), mean of 6.28 microvolt (C) and standard deviation of 12.03 microvolt (C) respectively for the criteria mentioned above.},

  abstract = {Cell-free architectures have recently emerged as a promising architecture with the potential to offer equal user-rates throughout the coverage area. Given the spectral congestion at sub-6 GHz bands, there is a pressing interest in evaluating the cell-free performance in the mmWave regime. This paper addresses the design and performance evaluation of the downlink segment of cell-free mmWave Massive MIMO system using hybrid precoders under the realistic assumption of capacity-constrained fronthaul links. Towards this end, a hybrid digital-analog beamforming is proposed where the high-dimensional analog part only depends on second-order large scale information. The low-dimensional digital part can then be implemented using standard precoding techniques that rely on instantaneous CSI. Numerical results demonstrate that this reduced-complexity architecture, when combined with an adequate user selection (scheduling), attains excellent Max-Min performance when operating under limited-fronthaul constraints.},

  abstract = {Frequency diverse array (FDA) has sparked intense interest in recent years because of its range-angle-dependent beampattern. By combining with the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technique, additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) are provided. However, dynamic environments require the design of a precisely controlled beampattern to enhance the robustness of the radar system. In this paper, the precise response control (PRC) algorithm is studied in the FDA-MIMO radar by imposing artificial interferences within rectangular regions in the joint transmit-receive spatial frequency domain. The algorithm is performed via two stages. In the first stage, artificial interferences are concurrently imposed to iteratively adjust the responses. In the second stage, extra artificial interferences are added to satisfy the predefined response requirement for all regions. The jammer-plus-noise covariance matrix is constructed accordingly and the weight vector is updated. Particularly, the jammer-to-noise ratio (JNR) of each artificial interference is figured out. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the performance of the transmit-receive two-dimensional beampattern in FDA-MIMO.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate whether purely neuro-mimetic architectures are more efficient for signal compression than architectures that combine neuroscience and state-of-the-art models. We are motivated to produce spikes, using the LIF model, in order to compress images. Seeking solutions to improve the efficiency of the LIF in terms of the memory cost, we compare two different quantization approaches; the Neuroinspired Quantization (NQ) and the Conventional Quantization (CQ). We present that when the LIF model and the NQ appear in the same architecture, the performance of the compression system is higher compared to an architecture that consists of the LIF model and the CQ. The main reason of this occurrence is the dynamic properties embedded in the neuro-mimetic models. As a consequence, we first study which are the dynamic properties of the recently released (NQ) which is an intuitive way of counting the number of spikes. Moreover, we show that some parameters of the NQ (i.e. the observation window and the resistance) strongly influence its behavior that ranges from non-uniform to uniform. As a result, the NQ is more flexible than the CQ when it is applied to real data while for the same bit rate it ensures higher reconstruction quality.},

  abstract = {The frequency-domain adaptive filter (FDAF) is very useful for instance acoustic signal processing. The partitioned-block FDAF (PBFDAF) is a generalization of the FDAF and becomes more popular due to its low latency. Some efforts have been done toward the convergence analysis of PBFDAFs, but they usually use strong approximations and hence came to inaccurate results. This paper presents a unified approach to the transient analysis of both the constrained and unconstrained PBFDAFs based on the overlap-save structure. Using the independence assumption, we derive the analytical expressions for the mean and mean-square performance of PBFDAFs. Our analysis does not assume a specific model for the inputs and provides a quite general framework. Computer simulations confirm a good match between our theory and experimental results.},

However, the impact of the different ASL schemes on connectivity estimates remains to be fully investigated. In this work, pulsed and pseudo continuous ASL (PASL/pCASL) were compared in terms of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and FC measures. In line with literature, higher CBF and increased spatial signal-to-noise ratio were reported for pCASL, as compared to PASL. In terms of FC, pCASL was able to more reliably recover the main networks and showed higher correlations between brain areas. These preliminary results suggest pCASL to provide reliable and stable results, not only for CBF estimation but also for FC analyses.},

The targets in the radar vision are naturally composed of multiple layers of different materials. Therefore, the interaction of these layers with the incident wave effects targets detection and classification. In order to enhance the quality of detection, we propose to exploit space-time waveforms which adapt with the targets multilayer response. We consider the backscattered signal power as the utility function to be maximized. The backscattered signal power maximization under transmit signal power constraint is formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). First, we assume a single-target scenario, where the resulting SDP yields an analytical solution. Second, we study the optimal waveform which considers the angle uncertainties of a target in the presence of a clutter. Third, having multiple targets and multiple clutters, the weighted sum of the backscattered signals power from the targets is maximized to deliver the backscattered power region outermost boundary. We observe that, when the targets material is given, the backscattered signal power can be significantly increased by optimal spatio-temporal waveform design. Moreover, we observe that by utilizing multiple temporal dimensions in the waveform design process, the number of exploited antennas can be significantly decreased.},

The proposed method was implemented on the latest HEVC reference encoder (HM 16.20), replacing the original local mode decision by the algorithm proposed in this paper. Experiments under the HEVC common test conditions, including UHD 4K (3840x2160 pixels) test sequences, showed, on average, 28.2% encoding time reduction, at a cost of 1.0% BD-BR (YUV) increase.

In this work, we take advantage of the particular structure of VAEs to refine WaveNet vocoders with the self-reconstructed features generated by VAE, which are of similar characteristics with the converted features while having the same temporal structure with the target natural features. We analyze these features and show that the self-reconstructed features are similar to the converted features.

Therefore, common performance evaluation toolkits are not applicable to real-world situations where the ground truth audio is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a performance evaluation technique that does not require reference signals in order to assess separation quality. The proposed technique uses a deep neural network (DNN) to map the processed audio into its quality score. Our experiment results show that the DNN is capable of predicting the sources-to-artifacts ratio from the blind source separation evaluation toolkit [1] for singing-voice separation without the need for reference signals.},

Unfortunately, the level of complexity to use and the order in which modes should be decomposed using the TTD is unclear. We advance TTD to a fully probabilistic TTD (PTTD) using variational Bayesian inference to account for parameter uncertainty and noise. In particular, we exploit that the PTTD enables model comparisons by use of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the variational approximation. On synthetic data with ground truth structure and a real 3-way fluorescence spectroscopy dataset, we demonstrate how the ELBO admits quantification of model specification not only in terms of numbers of components for each factor in the TTD, but also a suitable order of the modes in which the TTD should be employed. The proposed PTTD provides a principled framework for the characterization of model uncertainty, complexity, and model- and mode-order when compressing tensor data using the TTD.},

However, the effectiveness of these properties is not clear. Consequently, to construct a model robust to noise, statistical models based on heavy-tailed distributions are recently growing up. In this paper, as heavy-tailed models for the NMF, we introduce statistical models based on the complex Laplace distributions, and call them Laplace-NMF. Moreover, we derive convergence-guaranteed optimization algorithms to estimate parameters. From our formulation, a statistical interpretation of the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence-based NMF is newly revealed. We confirm the effectiveness of Laplace-NMF in semi-supervised audio denoising.},

While most of the existing works on wideband hybrid systems focus on single-user systems and a few on multi-user single-cell systems, we consider HBF design for OFDM systems in the case of multi-cell. We look at the maximization of weighted sum rate (WSR) using minorization and alternating optimization, the main advantage of which compared to the Weighted Sum Mean Squared Error (WSMSE) based methods is it's faster convergence to a local optimum and user streams selection. Through Simulation results, we show that the proposed deterministic annealing based approach for phase shifter constrained analog BF performs significantly better than state of the art Weighted Sum Mean Squared Error (WSMSE) or WSR based solutions in a wideband OFDM setting. We show that the optimal analog BF can be frequency flat and also provide an analysis of the minimum number of RF chains required to obtain fully digital performance.},

Envelope detection, inherently robust to this impairment, is hence considered for the design of sub-THz systems. This paper proposes an algebraic framework for envelope modulation. In the first place, we introduce a Hilbert space to represent waveforms with non-negative real values. This space is defined by transport of structure of the usual signal-space L2. So, existing schemes developed for real-valued signals can be exploited upon envelope modulation. In the second place, it is shown that the proposed framework provides powerful tools to design new envelope modulation schemes. To do so, we present the transmission of an Inphase Quadrature signal upon an envelope modulation to prevent the impact of phase noise on communication performance. We also demonstrate that constraints on embedded analog-to-digital converters can be relaxed with the use of orthogonal non-negative waveforms.},

For certain types of data and specific noise distributions, beta-divergence cost functions can lead to more meaningful low-rank approximations than those obtained with the LS cost function. Unfortunately, much of the low-rank structure that is heavily exploited in existing second-order LS methods, is no longer exploitable when moving to general β-divergences. In this paper, we show that, unlike in the general rank-R case, rank-1 structure can still be exploited. We therefore propose an efficient method that uses second-order information to compute nonnegative rank-1 approximations of tensors for general β-divergence cost functions.},

It denotes the planning of sequences of robotic movements to enhance tracking results of acoustic sources, e.g., talking humans, by fusing observations from multiple positions. Essentially, two strategies are possible: short-term planning, which results in greedy behavior, and long-term planning, which considers a sequence of possible future movements of the robot and the source. Here, we focus on the second method as it might improve tracking performance compared to greedy behavior and propose a path planning algorithm which exploits Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and particle filtering, based on a reward motivated by information-theoretic considerations.

As a side result, our approach yields a variant of the 3-D Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique which can deal with compressed data.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are applied to the time-harmonic electromagnetic diagnostic of a dielectric micro-structure. The latter consists of a finite number of circular cylinders (rods) with a fraction of wavelength radius that are set parallel to and at sub-wavelength distance from one another. Discrete scattered fields are made available around it in a free-space multisource-multireceiver configuration. The aim is to characterize this micro-structure, like positions of rods or their absence, and in effect to map their dielectric contrasts w.r.t. the embedding space. A computationally efficient field representation based on a method of moments (MoM) is available to model the field. Iterative, sparsity-constrained solutions work well to find missing rods, but may lack generality and need strong priors. As for time-reversal and like noniterative solutions, they may fail to capture the scattering complexity. These limitations can be alleviated by relying on deep learning concepts, here via convolutional neural networks. How to construct the inverse solver is focused onto. Representative numerical tests illustrate the performance of the approach in typical situations. Comparisons with results from a contrast-source inversion (CSI) introduced in parallel are performed. Emphasis is on potential super-resolution in harmony with subwavelength features of the micro-structure.},

  abstract = {A method for estimating the relevant quantities in a multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) for speech dereverberation is proposed for a microphone system consisting of a local microphone array (LMA) and a single external microphone (XM). Typically these MWF quantities can be estimated by considering pre-whitened correlation matrices with a dimension equal to the number of microphones in the system. By following another procedure involving a pre-whitening-transformation operation, it will be demonstrated that when a priori knowledge of the relative transfer function (RTF) vector pertaining to only the LMA is available and when the reverberant component of the signals received by the LMA is uncorrelated with that of the XM, the MWF quantities may be alternatively estimated from a 2 × 2 matrix. Simulations confirm that using such an estimate results in a similar performance to that obtained by using the higher-dimensional correlation matrix.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Sensor and lens blur degrade images acquired by digital cameras. Simple and fast removal of blur using linear filtering, such as Wiener filter, produces results that are not acceptable in most of the cases due to ringing artifacts close to image borders and around edges in the image. More elaborate deconvolution methods with non-smooth regularization, such as total variation, provide superior performance with less artifacts, however at a price of increased computational cost. We consider the alternating directions method of multipliers, which is a popular choice to solve such non-smooth convex problems, and show that individual steps of the method can be decomposed to simple filtering and element-wise operations. Filtering is performed with two sets of filters, called restoration and update filters, which are learned for the given type of blur and noise level with two different learning methods. The proposed deconvolution algorithm is implemented in the spatial domain and can be easily extended to include other restoration tasks such as demosaicing and super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate performance of the algorithm with respect to the size of learned filters, number of iterations, noise level and type of blur.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {While recent technological advances have focused on how to provide increased data rate in 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), very few attention has been paid on how the current microwave backhaul network can handle the transport of such huge traffic flows. In this paper, we address two key aspects for the efficient adaptation of the backhaul network to the upcoming SDN-enabled 5G wireless communications. First, we consider the availability of dedicated satellite links to off-load the traffic from the terrestrial backhaul links. These satellite links operate on the non-exclusive Ka band, which is shared with the terrestrial microwave backhaul links. Second, and given the interference limited scenario, we address the power control and flow assignment of the resulting satellite-terrestrial network. While most of the flow assignment works consider the link rates as fixed and given, here we provide a novel formulation which links the achievable link rates with the assigned transmission power. In particular, we propose an iterative joint power control and flow assignment which takes into account the long propagation delay imposed by the satellite links. We transform the resulting non-convex problem into a Geometric Programming (GP) problem, which can be optimally solved in an efficient way. Simulation results validate and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The increased autonomy of robots is directly linked to their capability to perceive their environment. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which associate perception and movement, are particularly interesting because they provide advanced autonomy to vehicles in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Such ITS are based on both proprioceptive sensors to estimate their dynamics and exteroceptive sensors in order to perceive the surrounding of the vehicle. This second class of sensor is dominated by camera and rotating range sensors such as LIDAR or RADAR. Indeed, the majority of intelligent vehicles uses today 2D/3D laser or panoramic radar to localize itself or detect and avoid obstacles. The use of a rotating range sensor, while moving at high speed, creates distortions in the collected data. Such an effect is, in the majority of studies, ignored or considered as noise and then corrected, based on additional proprioceptive sensors or localization systems. In this study, rather than considering distortion as a noise, we consider that it contains all the information about the vehicles displacement. We propose to extract this information from such distortion without any other information than the exteroceptive sensor data. The idea is to resort to velocimetry by only analyzing the distortion of the measurements. As a result, we propose a linear and angular velocities estimator of the mobile robot based on the distortion analysis.},

In this paper we present a novel method to synthesize 4D arrays by means of a finite set of Walsh functions. The technique allows for implementing the analog time-modulated feeding network of an array employing single-pole double-throw switches and achieves excellent rejection levels of the undesired harmonics.},

  abstract = {In estimating an unknown parameter vector in a linear regression model, it is common to use linearly constrained minimum variance estimators (LCMVEs). For a long time, LCMVEs were studied in the context of stationary constraints under both stationary or non-stationary environments. Recently, a new family of non-stationary constraints leading to Kalman-like recursive LCMVEs has been introduced for fully coherent signal (FCS) sources. A noteworthy feature of this family is to allow the possibility of, at each new observation, incorporating new constraints. This article extends these results to the case of partially coherent signal (PCS) sources. Indeed, without ad hoc modifications of the Kalman-like recursion, estimation of the amplitudes of PCS sources exhibit a performance breakdown even for a slight loss of coherence. Last but not least, it is shown that PCS sources introduce a lower limit in the achievable performance in the large sample regime.},

  abstract = {Standard methodologies for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data analysis decompose the observed Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signals using voxel-wise linear model and perform maximum likelihood estimation to get the parameters associated with the regressors. In task fMRI, the latter are usually defined from the experimental paradigm and some confounds whereas in resting-state acquisitions, a seed-voxel time-course may be used as predictor. Nowadays, most fMRI datasets offer resting-state acquisitions, requiring multivariate approaches (e.g., PCA, ICA, etc) to extract meaningful information in a data-driven manner. Here, we propose a novel low-rank model of fMRI BOLD data but instead of considering a dimension reduction in space as in ICA, our model relies on convolutional sparse coding between the hemodynamic system and a few temporal atoms which code for the neural activity inducing signals. A rank -1 constraint is also associated with each temporal atom to spatially map its influence in the brain. Within a variational framework, the joint estimation of the neural signals and the associated spatial maps is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. A local minimizer is computed using an efficient alternate minimization algorithm. The proposed approach is first validated on simulations and then applied to task fMRI data for illustration purpose. Its comparison to a state-of-the-art approach suggests that our method is competitive regarding the uncovered neural fingerprints while offering a richer decomposition in time and space.},

The maximum-likelihood estimator (ML) for the DOAs of deterministic signals carried by plane waves hidden in noise with a Laplace-like distribution is derived. This leads to a DOA estimator based on the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) criterion. We prove analytically that a weighted phase-only beamformer (which evaluates the scalar product between the steering vector and the complex signum function of the observed array data) is an approximation to a beamformer based on the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) criterion. The root mean squared error of DOA estimators versus SNR is compared in a simulation study: the conventional beamformer (CBF), the weighted phase-only beamformer, and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL3). This shows show that the ML estimator and weighted phase-only beamformer are well performing DOA estimators at low SNR for additive homoscedastic and heteroscedastic Gaussian noise, as well as Laplace-like noise.},

  abstract = {Time-variant beamforming (BF) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) are two techniques that are frequently employed for improving the quality of hands-free speech communication. However, the combined application of both is quite challenging as it either introduces high computational complexity or insufficient tracking. We propose a new method to improve the performance of the low-complexity beamformer first (BF-first) structure, which we call change prediction(ChaP). ChaP gathers information on several BF changes to predict the effective impulse response seen by the AEC after the next BF change. To account for uncertain data and convergence states in the predictions, reliability measures are introduced to improve ChaP in realistic scenarios.},

  abstract = {The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a popular generative latent variable model that is often used for representation learning. Standard VAEs assume continuous-valued latent variables and are trained by maximization of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Conventional methods obtain a differentiable estimate of the ELBO with reparametrized sampling and optimize it with Stochastic Gradient Descend (SGD). However, this is not possible if we want to train VAEs with discrete-valued latent variables, since reparametrized sampling is not possible. In this paper, we propose an easy method to train VAEs with binary or categorically valued latent representations. Therefore, we use a differentiable estimator for the ELBO which is based on importance sampling. In experiments, we verify the approach and train two different VAEs architectures with Bernoulli and categorically distributed latent representations on two different benchmark datasets.},

The spiralling demand for multi-sensored personal communication devices has played a major role in this, producing images and leaving digital trails of transactions and texts to be mined for patterns. Consequently, the cutting edge of data analysis tools has been targeted for images. However the copious amounts of data required to successfully train these tools are not available in several fields such as rehabilitation where there are constraints on data collection. And yet the need for timely clinical assessments grows.We consider how to address this situation by generating synthetic, surrogate data which preserves many properties of the original. Here we introduce a new application of surrogate time series in a novel classification scheme, compare methods of converting these into images and use a state of the art neural network framework for a successful improvement in classification results.This is a significant contribution to the art, demonstrating how scarce time series data can be successfully augmented to take advantage of cutting edge analytical tools.},

  abstract = {The fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) is a widely used procedure for minimizing the sum of two convex functions, such that one has a L-Lipschitz continuous gradient and the other is possible nonsmooth. While FISTA's theoretical rate of convergence (RoC) is proportional to (1/αktk2), and it is related to (i) its extragradient rule / inertial sequence, which depends on sequence tk, and (ii) the step-size αk, which estimates L, its worst-case complexity results in O(k-2) since, originally, (i) by construction tk ≥ (k+1/2), and (ii) the condition αk ≥ αk+1 was imposed. Attempts to improve FISTA's RoC include alternative inertial sequences, and intertwining the selection of the inertial sequence and the step-size.In this paper, we show that if a bounded and non-decreasing step-size sequence (αk ≤ αk+1, decoupled from the inertial sequence) can be generated via some adaptive scheme, then FISTA can achieve a RoC proportional to k-3 for the indexes where the step-size exhibits an approximate linear growth, with the default O(k-2) behavior when the step-size's bound is reached. Furthermore, such exceptional step-size sequence can be easily generated, and it indeed boots FISTA's practical performance.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The scenario of a mixture of two speakers captured by a microphone array in a noisy and reverberant environment is considered. If the problems of source separation and dereverberation are treated separately, performance degradation may result. It is well-known that the performance of blind source separation (BSS) algorithms degrades in the presence of reverberation, unless reverberation effects are properly addressed (leading to the so-called convolutive BSS algorithms). Similarly, the performance of common dereverberation algorithms will severely degrade if an interference signal is also captured by the same microphone array. The aim of the proposed method is to jointly separate and dereverberate the two speech sources, by extending the Kalman expectation-maximization for dereverberation (KEMD) algorithm, previously proposed by the authors. A statistical model is attributed to this scenario, using the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, and the expectation-maximization (EM) scheme is applied to obtain a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the parameters. In the expectation step, the separated clean signals are extracted from the observed data by the application of a Kalman Filter, utilizing the parameters that were estimated in the previous iteration. The maximization step updates the parameters estimation according to the Estep output. Simulation results shows that the proposed method improves both the separation of the signals and their overall quality.},

  abstract = {We previously proposed the virtual microphone technique to improve the speech enhancement performance in underdetermined situations, in which the number of channels is virtually increased by estimating extra observed signals at arbitrary positions along the straight line formed by real microphones. In our previous work, the effectiveness of the interpolation of virtual microphone signals for speech enhancement was experimentally confirmed. In this study, to examine the effectiveness of the extrapolation of a virtual microphone in improving the speech enhancement performance, we apply this technique to speech enhancement using a maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamformer. Next, to improve the speech enhancement performance on the basis of the virtual microphone technique, we propose a new arrangement where a virtual microphone is placed in a position proportional to the wavelength. From the results of an experiment in an underdetermined situation, we confirmed that the proposed method markedly improves speech enhancement performance. Moreover, we present directivity patterns to confirm the behavior of each method of positioning the virtual microphone.},

  abstract = {The Shannon sampling theorem states the lowest sampling rate for the lowpass bandlimited signals. But for multiband bandlimited signals, it is inefficient to apply the Shannon sampling theorem. This is because the existence of gaps between successive bands makes it possible to realize sampling at a rate, which is lower than the Nyquist rate and lower-bounded by Nyquist-Landau rate. The Nyquist-Landau rate for multiband signals, can be attained via periodic nonuniform sampling. However, it is still very challenging to find the sampling rate for multiband bandlimited signals such that the average sampling rate approaches the Nyquist-Landau rate. In this paper, we aim to find the feasible range of sub-Nyquist sampling rate (such that uniform sampling at this rate causes no aliasing) for two-band signals without aliasing. In this paper, an efficient method to find the constraints on the sampling frequency of two-band signals is devised. The normal placement and inverse placement of the spectrum are considered. Guard bands are considered to increase the robustness of the proposed sampling scheme. Analytical study is provided to obtain the allowable region of sampling frequencies. The derived low sampling rate ensures a relaxed requirement in terms of sampling, processing and memory.},

  abstract = {The so-called Partial Relaxation approach has recently been proposed to solve the Direction-of-Arrival estimation problem. In this paper, we extend the previous work by applying Covariance Fitting with a data model that includes the noise covariance. Instead of applying a single source approximation to multi-source estimation criteria, which is the case for MUSIC, the conventional beamformer, or the Capon beamformer, the Partial Relaxation approach accounts for the existence of multiple sources using a non-parametric modification of the signal model. In the Partial Relaxation framework, the structure of the desired direction is kept, whereas the sensor array manifold corresponding to the remaining signals is relaxed [1], [2]. This procedure allows to compute a closed-form solution for the relaxed signal part and to come up with a simple spectral search with a significantly reduced computational complexity. Unlike in the existing Partial Relaxed Covariance Fitting approach, in this paper we utilize more prior-knowledge on the structure of the covariance matrix by also considering the noise covariance. Simulation results show that, the proposed method outperforms the existing Partial Relaxed Covariance Fitting method, especially in difficult conditions with small sample size and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Its threshold performance is close to that of Deterministic Maximum Likelihood, but at significantly lower cost.},

Many algorithms have been introduced to this aim, which minimize the representation error subject to a sparseness constraint on X. However, the dictionary learning problem is non-convex with respect to the pair (D,X). In a previous work [Sadeghi et at., 2013], a convex approximation to the non-convex term DX has been introduced which makes the whole DL problem convex. This approach can be almost applied to any existing DL algorithm and obtain better algorithms. In the current paper, it is shown that a simple modification on that approach significantly improves its performance, in terms of both accuracy and speed. Simulation results on synthetic dictionary recovery are provided to confirm this claim.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a manifold based facial expression recognition framework which utilizes the intrinsic structure of the data distribution to accurately classify the expression categories. Specifically, we model the expressive faces as the points on linear subspaces embedded in a Grassmannian manifold, also called as expression manifold. We propose the dual-threshold based local patch (DTLP) extraction method for constructing the local subspaces, which in turn approximates the expression manifold. Further, we use the affinity of the face points from the subspaces for classifying them into different expression classes. Our method is evaluated on four publicly available databases with two well known feature extraction techniques. It is evident from the results that the proposed method efficiently models the expression manifold and improves the recognition accuracy in spite of the simplicity of the facial representatives.},

The aim of this conversion is to ensure a good visual rendering of the displayed Tone Mapped (TM) HDR images in accordance with the observers' assessment. To do so, the proposed algorithm adjusts a piecewise linear function to the logarithm luminance distribution of the HDR image to adapt this transformation to the perceptual quantizer in accordance with the Human Visual System (HVS). The computation of the slope value of the piecewise linear transformation is simplified. Indeed, it is given by the ratio between the probability and the logarithm luminance distance in the sampling bin. This leads to histograms which tend to be flat, thus inducing a contrast enhancement of the tone mapped HDR images in both under-exposed and overexposed areas. Simulation results provide good results, both in terms of visual quality and TMQI metric, compared to existing competitive TM approaches.},

For the last years, a great deal of interest has been paid to compare them and to better understand their behaviors from a mathematical point of view. In this paper, our contribution is the following: we first propose to express the square of the so-called fluctuation function as a 2D Fourier transform (2D-FT) of the product of two matrices. The first one is defined from the instantaneous correlations of the signal while the second, called the weighting matrix, is representative of each method. Therefore, the 2D-FT of the weighting matrix is analyzed in each case. In this study, differences between the DFA and the DMA are pointed out when the approaches are applied on non-stationary processes.},

We evaluate our method with the instrumental SIR and SAR measures as well as an auditory distortion measure (ADR) on a database of 110 classical chamber music pieces.

In the forthcoming years, AV1 is expected to be adopted by several companies and streaming service providers as the main digital video format. In this paper, the compression efficiency and the computational cost of AV1 is compared to its main concurrent, the HEVC standard. The methodology employed in this work uses equivalent quantization parameters in both encoders to measure compression efficiency in terms of Bjontegaard Delta (BD)-rate more accurately than related works. Experimental results show that the AV1 reference software requires an average computational cost 14.64 times greater than the HEVC Model, with a BD-rate increase of 16.35% in comparison to that encoder.},

The classes in target domain are usually seen as a subset in source domain. Partial domain adaptation aims to tackle this generalization issue where no labeled data are provided in target domain. This paper presents an adversarial learning for partial domain adaptation where a symmetric metric based on the Wasserstein distance is adopted in an adversarial learning objective. We build a Wasserstein partial transfer network where the Wasserstein adversarial objective is jointly optimized to partially transfer the relevance knowledge from source to target domains. The geometric property for optimal transport is assured to mitigate the gradient vanishing problem in adversarial training. The neural network components for feature extraction, relevance transfer, domain matching and task classification are jointly trained by solving a minimax optimization over multiple objectives. Experiments on image classification show the merits of the proposed partially adversarial domain adaptation over different tasks.},

However, this, in turn, has raised new technical challenges on the security issue, and calls for the design of new frameworks to exploit multi-device diversity. In this paper, we take the advantage of this benefit while preserving the privacy. Specifically, 1). To address the privacy issue, we develop a low-complexity encrypting algorithm based on random unitary transform, where it is proved both theoretically and through simulation that such encryption will not affect the result of face recognition. 2). To exploit multi-device diversity, we integrate the recognition results based on the dictionaries of each device into an aggregated output through ensemble learning, which has shown higher correctness of predictability than any individual methods. The designed framework not only contributes to the reduction of computation complexity at each device, but also proves to be effective and robust through simulation results.},

The uniqueness of this methodology from other adaptive importance sampling (AIS) schemes is in the weighting procedure, where at each iteration of the algorithm, all samples are re-weighted according to the temporal deterministic mixture approach. This re-weighting allows for substantial variance reduction of the AMIS estimator, at the expense of an increased computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel AIS methodology which obtains most of the AMIS variance reduction while improving upon its computational complexity. The proposed method implements an approximate version of the temporal deterministic mixture approach and requires substantially less computation. Advantages are shown empirically through a numerical example, where the novel method is able to attain a desired mean-squared error with much less computation.},

Furthermore, the sparsity of the unknown signal is modeled by a parameterized sparse prior while the inference procedure is conducted using the Variational Bayesian framework. Experimental results, using 1D and 2D signals, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance compared to state-of-the-art Compressive Sensing reconstruction algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an interpolated computationally efficient subspace-based method without eigendecomposition (ISUMWE) for the direction-of-arrivals (DOA) estimation of narrowband coherent signals in arbitrary linear arrays. ISUMWE estimates DOA based on the outputs of the virtual array by using an interpolation transform technique. Therefore, it overcomes the common restriction of uniform linear array (ULA) geometry when estimating coherent signals and becomes suitable for more general array geometry than ordinary methods. Meanwhile, the coherency of incident signals is decorrelated through a linear operation of a matrix formed from the cross-correlations between some sensor data in a designed virtual array which can be computed from the linear transformation of sensor data in the real array, where the effect of additive noise is eliminated. Consequently, the DOA can be estimated without performing eigendecomposition, and the noise pre-whitening which is required in traditional interpolation procedure can be avoided. As a result, the ISUMWE extends the application of the original subspace-based method without eigendecomposition (SUMWE) into arbitrary linear array with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Voice user interfaces have increased in popularity, as they enable natural interaction with different applications using one's voice. To improve their usability and audio quality, several devices could interact to provide a unified voice user interface. However, with devices cooperating and sharing voice-related information, user privacy may be at risk. Therefore, access management rules that preserve user privacy are important. State-of-the-art methods for acoustic pairing of devices provide fingerprinting based on the time-frequency representation of the acoustic signal and error-correction. We propose to use such acoustic fingerprinting to authorise devices which are acoustically close. We aim to obtain fingerprints of ambient audio adapted to the requirements of voice user interfaces. Our experiments show that the responsiveness and robustness is improved by combining overlapping windows and decorrelating transforms.},

  abstract = {Source localization for near-field narrowband signal is an important topic in array signal processing. Deep neural network (DNN) based methods are data-driven and free of pre-assumptions about data model and are expected to learn the intricate nonlinear structure in large data sets. This paper proposes a framework of DNN where a regression layer is utilized to address the problem of near-field source localization. Unlike previous studies in which DOA estimation is modeled as a classification problem and have a relatively low resolution, we exploit a regression model and aim to improve the estimation accuracy. In the training stage, we propose a novel form of feature representation to take full advantage of the convolution networks. In addition, the architecture of deep neural networks is well designed taking in to consideration the trade-off between the expression ability and under-training risks. The simulation results show that the proposed approach has a rather high validation accuracy with a high resolution, and also outperforms some conventional methods in adverse environments such as low signal to noise ratio (SNR) or small number of snapshots.},

Also realistic performance results are provided and analyzed, in the context of mmWave NR deployment for high-speed trains at 30 GHz carrier frequency. It is shown that below 3 m positioning accuracy can be achieved with 95% availability, which fits in the positioning performance requirements for traffic monitoring and control, as specified by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Moreover, the given positioning performance can be achieved without assuming clock synchronization between the baseband units (BBUs) at the network side. In fact, the proposed approach enables sub-nanosecond estimation accuracy of network clock offsets, which benefits various radio resource management (RRM) functionalities of the network for increased spectral efficiency.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Continual use, as well as aging, allows cracks to develop on concrete surfaces. These cracks are early indications of surface degradation. Therefore, regular inspection of surfaces is an important step in preventive maintenance, allowing reactive measures in a timely manner when cracks may impair the integrity of a structure. Automating parts of this inspection process provides the potential for improved performance and more efficient resource usage, as these inspections are usually carried out manually by trained inspectors. In this work we propose a Fully Convolutional, U-Net based, Neural Network architecture to automatically segment cracks. Conventional pooling operations in Convolutional Neural Networks are static operations that reduce the spatial size of an input, which may lead to loss of information as features are discarded. In this work we introduce and incorporate a novel pooling function into our architecture, Gated Scale Pooling. This operation aims to retain features from multiple scales as well as adapt proactively to the feature map being pooled. Training and testing of our network architecture is conducted on three different public surface crack datasets. It is shown that employing Gated Scale Pooling instead of Max Pooling achieves superior results. Furthermore, our experiments also indicate strongly competitive results when compared with other crack segmentation techniques.},

The nuisance parameters are estimated under the null hypothesis via the measure-transformed Gaussian quasi MLE. In the paper, we analyze the effect of the probability measure-transformation on the asymptotic detection performance of the extended MT-GQST. This leads to a data-driven procedure for selection of the generating function of the considered transform, called MT-function, which, in practice, weights the data points. Furthermore, we provide conditions on the MT-function to ensure stability of the asymptotic false-alarm-rate in the presence of noisy outliers. The extended MT-GQST is applied for testing a vector parameter of interest comprising a noisy multivariate linear data model in the presence of nuisance parameters. Simulation study illustrates its advantages over other robust detectors.},

In this paper, we present a new strategy to detect mild to severe patterns of periodic breathing using a single electrocardiogram signal in patients with severe heart failure. We first compute three time series, extracted from the ECG signal namely Heart-Rate Variability, R-Wave Amplitude and Mean Cardiac Axis. Then, these series are used to estimate an oscillation index that can quantify periodic breathing through time and a one-minute decision is made using an experimental thresholding to decide whether periodic breathing is absent or present. Eight patients with normal to severe periodic breathing are selected to test our method. The results obtained are compared to those performed by experts.},

Comparison of the energy compaction level between the 2-D separable Q-PUFB based on the 1D Q-PUFB (8×24 Q-PUFB one-dimensional coding gain is CG1D = 9.38 dB) and 2D non-separable Q-PUFB (8 × 24 2D-NSQ-PUFB, multidimensional coding gain is CGMD = 17.15 dB) for the Barbara image shows that the 2-D non-separable Q-PUFB generates a higher percentage of small-value coefficients, hence creates a significant increase in the number of zero trees.

  abstract = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) devices have been largely considered for indoor location systems due to their high accuracy. However, as in other wireless systems, such accuracy is significantly degraded under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation conditions. Therefore, the identification of NLOS conditions is essential to mitigate inaccuracies due to NLOS propagation. Nonetheless, most of the techniques considered to identify NLOS situations are based on the study of the channel impulse response (CIR), which is not practical and even becomes unfeasible when employing low-cost UWB hardware. This is precisely the main motivation of this work, to introduce a classification system based on the statistics of both the received signal strength (RSS) and range available from low-cost UWB devices. We analyze the effect of considering different statistic sets of both the RSS and range as features to feed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is experimentally evaluated by means of measurements carried out in a real scenario where both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS conditions are present.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the recently launched AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) bitstream specification, there is currently a need for converting legacy content encoded with the state-of-the-art High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard to the new format. However, transcoding is a complex task composed of a decoding and an encoding process in sequence, which requires long processing time and high energy consumption. This paper proposes a complexity scalable HEVC-to-AV1 transcoding solution with three operation modes, which allow adjusting the tradeoff between encoding efficiency and computational cost. The solution is based on the high correlation between block size decisions in HEVC and AV1, allowing the AV1 encoder to inherit Coding Tree depth information from the HEVC bitstream to constrain the AV1 re-encoding process. Experimental results for the three operation modes show a transcoding time reduction between 35.4% and 69.5% at the cost of a compression efficiency loss that varies between 4.9% and 16.8%.},

In this paper, we propose a method to find the rank of a symmetric tensor. We reformulate the CP decomposition problem into a truncated moment problem and we derive a sufficient condition to certify the rank of the tensor from the rank of some moment matrices associated with it. For tensors with rank not exceeding a prescribed value, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Finally, we propose to combine our rank detection procedure with existing algorithms. Experimental results show the validity of our results and provide an illustration of its practical use. Our method provides the correct rank even in the presence a moderate level of noise.},

Shape matrices most often own a particular structure depending on the application of interest and taking this structure into account improves estimation accuracy. In the framework of robust estimation, we introduce a recursive robust shape matrix estimation technique based on Tyler'sM -estimate for convexly structured shape matrices. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent, asymptotically efficient and Gaussian distributed and we notice that it reaches its asymptotic regime faster as the number of recursions increases. Finally, in the particular wide spreaded case of Hermitian persymmetric structure, we study the convergence of the recursions of the proposed algorithm.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Multi-hop route optimization in large-scale inhomogeneous networks typically requires the use of constrained optimization tools, yielding processing complexity that scales like O(N3), N being the number of relays employed. Here, we propose an alternative approach to route optimization by considering the limit of infinite relay node density to develop a continuum model, which yields an optimized equivalent continuous relay path. The model is carefully constructed to maintain a constant connection density even though the node density scales without bound. This leads to a formulation for minimizing the end-to-end outage probability that can be solved using methods from the calculus of variations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach and its potential for reducing processing complexity by considering a network subjected to a point source of interference.},

  abstract = {The development of Automatic Lip-Reading (ALR) systems is currently dominated by Deep Learning (DL) approaches. However, DL systems generally face two main issues related to the amount of data and the complexity of the model. To find a balance between the amount of available training data and the number of parameters of the model, in this work we introduce an end-to-end ALR system that combines CNNs and LSTMs and can be trained without large-scale databases. To this end, we propose to split the training by modules, by automatically generating weak labels per frames, termed visual units. These weak visual units are representative enough to guide the CNN to extract meaningful features that when combined with the context provided by the temporal module, are sufficiently informative to train an ALR system in a very short time and with no need for manual labeling. The system is evaluated in the well-known OuluVS2 database to perform sentence-level classification. We obtain an accuracy of 91.38% which is comparable to state-of the-art results but, differently from most previous approaches, we do not require the use of external training data.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider efficient message passing based inference in a factor graph representation of a probabilistic model. Current message passing methods, such as belief propagation, variational message passing or expectation propagation, rely on analytically pre-computed message update rules. In practical models, it is often not feasible to analytically derive all update rules for all factors in the graph and as a result, efficient message passing-based inference cannot proceed. In related research on (non-message passing-based) inference, a “reparameterization trick” has lead to a considerable extension of the class of models for which automated inference is possible. In this paper, we introduce Reparameterization Gradient Message Passing (RGMP), which is a new message passing method based on the reparameterization gradient. In most models, the large majority of messages can be analytically derived and we resort to RGMP only when necessary. We will argue that this kind of hybrid message passing leads naturally to low-variance gradients.},

The conversion method is derived by comparing the sound field created by a higher-order derivative of the free field Green's function and the corresponding field expressed by circular harmonic expansion coefficients in 2D space. In contrast to an existing analytical conversion method, the proposed method reproduces not only directivity patterns but also phases of the radiated sound from a target sound source, thereby enabling accurate sound field synthesis. We used numerical simulations to show that the proposed method achieved more accurate sound field reproduction than an existing pressure-matching-based method at higher frequency regions.},

  abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) and dictionary learning (DL) methods are widely used to analyse resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) in multi-subject studies. These methods aim at decomposing the multi-subject data into common spatial abundance maps and their related temporal signatures. We are interested here in such a decomposition for a single-subject rs-fMRI dataset. The above-mentioned methods often fail in this case because the problem becomes too ill-posed, requiring the use of additional prior information and the design of novel regularising constraints. The poor resolution of rs-fMRI data is an additional source of difficulty, yielding noisy and blurry spatial maps. In this paper, we propose a new DL formulation adapted to the unique subject by integrating high-resolution (HR) spatial information to constrain single-subject data unmixing. HR information is provided by the registration of an anatomical atlas on the data set. We show on a quasi-real dataset from mice, the benefit of using an HR spatial segmentation map in the decomposition of low-resolution rs-fMRI.},

Two subjective tests were conducted to assess the quality in terms of perceived severity of judder in compressed video sequences.

To face this problem an effective machine learning technique based on particle-Bernstein polynomials has been used to model the input-output relationship that describes the system. The approach has been validated by identifying two real world nonlinear systems, in the fields of speech signals and nonlinear audio amplifiers.},

The PPG signals are recorded using a commercial wrist worn device.

  abstract = {360° videos are represented in spherical projection formats and the video quality of such videos is assessed using spherical objective quality metrics. Furthermore, the objective video quality between two different spherical projection formats can be evaluated using Cross projection metrics. Craster parabola, is a 2D cross projection format which is used by Craster Parabolic Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CPPPSNR) metric. The existing CPPPSNR measurements do not consider the subsampling locations during the quality assessment to match the pixel density of a sphere. Nevertheless, it is vitally important to account for the oversampled projection formats and the sphere in order to be compatible with the existing video encoding architectures. To this end, the proposed improvements to the CPPPSNR locates the subsample points during craster parabolic projection and use nearest neighbor interpolation to assign pixels from the craster parabolic projection. Furthermore, in order to compensate the occurrence of oversampling, appropriate weights are applied to the corresponding pixels. The proposed method was tested with Shanghai Jiao Ton University (SJTU) Virtual Reality (VR) sequences for projection conversion. The comparison between Spherical PSNR (SPSNR) and existing CPPPSNR, validate the proposed CPPPSNR as an objective quality metric for cross projections.},

The approach shares many similarities with RIR measurements based on perfect periodic sequences (PPSs). In contrast to PPSs, the proposed approach is able to directly measure the impulse response for small signals of the measurement system.

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) allows the acquisition of spatial information of a scene along multiple spectral bands using fewer projected measurements than traditional scanning methods. In general, to obtain high resolution spatial and spectral information, expensive detectors and sophisticated optical devices are required. Fortunately, the single-pixel camera (SPC) is a low-cost optical architecture since it uses a light sensor compared to CSI architectures with larger sensors. However, this advantage is overshadowed by the large number of projections needed to recover the spectral image, which entails large acquisition times. Alternatively, high-resolution spectral images can be obtained using SPC with side-information, without significantly increasing acquisition costs. However, this approach retrieves improved resolution images applying iterative and computationally expensive algorithms. This paper proposes a non-iterative method that combines the spectral information of SPC and the side information of a multispectral image to recover high resolution spatial and spectral information. The proposed fast compressive spectral imaging (FCSI) reconstruction method exploits the fact that the spatial-spectral data lie in a low dimensional subspace. This methodology allows to reduce the number of required measurements in the SPC as well as the computation time of the reconstruction. Simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to similar approaches, both in reconstruction quality and sample complexity.},

We also propose a highly effective strongly supervised attention model when strong labels are available. This model also serves as an upper bound for the self-supervised model. The performances of the model with self-supervised attention training are comparable to the strongly supervised one which is trained using strong labels.

  abstract = {Phase Retrieval (PR) in X-ray Crystallography (XC) is an inverse problem that consists on recovering an image from phaseless data. Recently, it has been shown that an image in XC can be sparsely represented in the Fourier domain. This fact implies that the number of required measurements to retrieve the phase in XC is determined by the sparsity, which is much smaller than the size of the image. However, the computational complexity to retrieve the phase still depends on the image size, implying more time to solve this problem in XC. Therefore, this work proposes a reconstruction algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the image by grouping sets of pixels of its sparse representation, called super-pixels, in order to reduce the total number of unknowns in the inverse problem. The proposed recovery methodology leads to a reduction in time of at least 80% and improves the reconstruction quality in up to 6% in terms of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to state-of-art counterparts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for the non-local restoration of single-photon 3-Dimensional Lidar images acquired in the photon starved regime or with a reduced number of scanned spatial points (pixels). The algorithm alternates between two steps: evaluation of the spatial correlations between pixels using a graph, then restore the depth and reflectivity images by their spatial correlations. To reduce the computational cost associated with the graph, we adopt a non-uniform sampling approach, where bigger patches are assigned to homogeneous regions and smaller ones to heterogeneous regions. The restoration of 3D images is achieved by minimizing a cost function accounting for the data Poisson statistics and the non-local spatial correlations between patches. This minimization problem is efficiently solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that presents fast convergence properties. Results on real Lidar data show the benefits of the proposed algorithm in improving the quality of the estimated depth images, especially in photon starved cases, which can contain a reduced number of photons.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a weakly-supervised approach to Automatic Chord Estimation (ACE) task that aims to estimate a sequence of chords from a given music audio signal at the frame level, under a realistic condition that only non-aligned chord annotations are available. In conventional studies assuming the availability of time-aligned chord annotations, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that learn frame-wise mappings from acoustic features to chords have attained excellent performance. The major drawback of such frame-wise models is that they cannot be trained without the time alignment information. Inspired by a common approach in automatic speech recognition based on nonaligned speech transcriptions, we propose a two-step method that trains a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the forced alignment between chord annotations and music signals, and then trains a powerful frame-wise DNN model for ACE. Experimental results show that although the frame-level accuracy of the forced alignment was just under 90%, the performance of the proposed method was degraded only slightly from that of the DNN model trained by using the ground-truth alignment data. Furthermore, using a sufficient amount of easily collected non-aligned data, the proposed method is able to reach or even outperform the conventional methods based on ground-truth time-aligned annotations.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {A novel inverse tone mapping network, called “iTMNet”, is proposed in this paper. For training iTM-Net, we also propose a novel loss function considering the pixel distribution of HDR images. In inverse tone mapping with CNNs, we first point out that training CNNs with a standard loss function causes a problem, due to the distribution of HDR images. To overcome the problem, the novel loss function non-linearly tone-maps target HDR images into LDR ones, on the basis of a tone mapping operator, and then the distance between the tone-mapped image and a predicted one is calculated. The proposed loss function enables us not only to normalize HDR images but also to distribute pixel values of HDR images, like LDR ones.

  abstract = {The most difficult task in financial forecasting is the accurate price prediction based on previous values. Two cases are studied: stock price prediction and flight price prediction. A dyadic particle filter is proposed that is based on sequential importance resampling. This dyadic particle filter captures the dynamic evolution of a pair of latent vectors. In stock price prediction, one latent vector is defined for each stock. This latent vector is paired with a market segment latent vector introduced for each group of companies of the same category. Both latent vectors capture the hidden information of the stock market and reinforce the state estimation procedure. This hidden information influences strongly the performance of the particle filter, yielding more accurate prediction of stock prices than the state-of-the-art techniques. For flight price prediction, the pair of latent vectors corresponds to route and destination, respectively. Given the price range of each flight, promising results are disclosed.},

  abstract = {The stress in a driver, happening during unforeseen events or taxing situations, is linked to a subject's sympathetic system response. We present a system which detects the stress presence in car drivers through the analysis of an endosomatic Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal, namely, Skin Potential Response (SPR), coupled with the analysis of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. To log these signals we utilize a device which records the SPR from each hand of the driver, and the ECG from the chest. In the case of the SPR signal, since the hands movement injects motion artifacts, we also utilize an algorithm that dynamically selects the smoother signal coming from the two hands, and is thus able to output a clean SPR signal. Statistical features are then derived from the ECG and SPR signals, allowing their classification using a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. Various subjects were tested in an environment set in a company which develops professional driving simulators, both in hardware and software, and consisted in a motorized platform, a cockpit and a 180° projection screen. The test encompassed driving through a highway, with some unforeseen events happening at some positions. In the end we get a Balanced Accuracy in stress detection of 77.59 % for the considered events.},

Among the various frequency estimation methods, this paper compares and connects the reassigned spectrum and an iterative, nonlinear Least Squares method referred to as iQHM (iterative Quasi Harmonic Model). Interestingly, there are subtle connections between these two -seemingly different- iterative methods both in frequency as well in time domain. Moreover, inspired by the optimal performance of reassigned spectrum for mono-component sinusoidal signals, a variant of iQHM is proposed. The new method improves the performance of the original iQHM approach in frequency estimation by increasing the region of convergence by 40% on average.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach to virtually increasing the number of microphone elements between two real microphones to improve speech enhancement performance in underdetermined situations. The virtual microphone technique, with which virtual signals in the audio signal domain are estimated by linearly interpolating the phase and nonlinearly interpolating the amplitude independently on the basis of β-divergence, has been recently proposed and experimentally shown to be effective in improving speech enhancement performance. Furthermore, it has been reported that the performance tends to improve as the nonlinearity is improved. However, one drawback of this method is that the interpolation is employed in each time-frequency bin independently, in which the spectral and temporal structures of speech signals are ignored. To address this problem and improve the nonlinearity, motivated by the high capability of neural networks to model nonlinear functions and speech spectrograms, in this paper, we propose an alternative method of amplitude interpolation. In this method, we employ a convolutional neural network as an amplitude estimator that minimizes the mean squared error between the outputs of a minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) beamformer and the target speech signals. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method showed high potential for improving speech enhancement performance, which was not only superior to that of the conventional virtual microphone technique but also the performance in the corresponding determined situation.},

  abstract = {Studies on identification of species-specific protein regions, i.e., unique or highly dissimilar regions with respect to close species, will lead us to understanding of evolutionary traits, which can be related to novel functionalities or diseases. In this paper, we propose an alignment-free method to find and visualize distinct regions between two collections of proteins. We applied the proposed method, FRUIT, on multiple synthetic and real datasets to analyze its behavior when different rates of substitutional mutation occur. Testing with different k-mer sizes showed that the higher the mutation rate, the higher the relative uniqueness. We also employed FRUIT to find and visualize distinct regions in modern human proteins relatively to the proteins of Altai, Sidron and Vindija Neanderthals. The results show that four of the most distinct proteins, named ataxin -8, 60S ribosomal protein L26, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 3 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 are involved in SCA8, DBAII, LS and MT-CID, and MT-C4D diseases, respectively. There is also Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, among others, which is part of the immune system. Besides, we report the most similar primate exomes to the found modern human one, in terms of identity, query cover and length of sequences. The reported results can give us insight to the evolution of proteomes.},

It is of paramount importance that the large amount of images collected over time, and organized in multidimensional arrays known as tensors, be efficiently compressed in order to be stored or transmitted. In this paper, we present a compression algorithm which involves a training process and employs a symbol encoding dictionary. During training, we derive specially structured tensors from a given image time sequence using the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. During runtime, every new image time sequence is quantized and encoded into a vector of coefficients corresponding to the learned CP decomposition. Experimental results on sequences of real satellite images demonstrate that we can efficiently handle higher-order tensors and obtain the decompressed data by composing the learned tensors by means of the received vector of coefficients, thus achieving a high compression ratio.},

In this context, one of the most interesting applications of VLC is their use in vehicular communications using the headlights of trucks, cars or motorbikes. However, the vehicular communications are subject to blocking from other elements of the network or weather effects such as rain or fog. To solve these issues we propose the use of multi-photodiode receivers following an angle diversity distribution. In particular, in this work we focus on a configuration that considers a single signal processing chain connected to the set of photodiodes through a selector referred to as reconfigurable photodetector. First, we obtain the experimental evaluation of the optical channel considering high-power optical transmitters and several angle diversity configurations. After that, an offline evaluation of the blind interference alignment (BIA) scheme is carried out in comparison with a diversity scheme such as maximum ratio combining (MRC).},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Phase retrieval is an inverse problem which consists on estimating a complex signal from intensity-only measurements. Recent works have studied the problem of retrieving the phase of a high-resolution image from low-resolution phaseless measurements, under a setup that records coded diffraction patterns. However, the attainable resolution of the image depends on the sensor characteristics, whose cost increases in proportion to the resolution. Also, this methodology lacks theoretical analysis. Hence, this work derives a super-resolution model from low-resolution coded phaseless measurements, that in contrast with prior contributions, the attainable resolution of the image directly depends on the resolution of the coded aperture. For this model we establish that an image can be recovered (up to a global unimodular constant) with high probability. Also, the theoretical result states that the image reconstruction quality directly depends on the design of the coded aperture. Therefore, a strategy that designs the spatial distribution of the coded aperture is developed. Simulation results show that reconstruction quality using designed coded aperture is higher than the non-designed ensembles.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been successfully developing as a generative model where the artificial data drawn from the generator are misrecognized as real samples by a discriminator. Although GAN achieves the desirable performance, the challenge is that the mode collapse easily happens in the joint optimization of generator and discriminator. This study copes with this challenge by improving the model regularization by means of representing the weight uncertainty in GAN. A new Bayesian GAN is formulated and implemented to learn a regularized model from diverse data where the strong modes are flattened via the marginalization and the issues of model collapse and gradient vanishing are alleviated. In particular, we present a variational GAN (VGAN) where the encoder, generator and discriminator are jointly estimated according to the variational Bayesian inference. The experiments on image generation over two tasks (MNIST and CeleA) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed VGAN to the variational autoencoder, the standard GAN and the Bayesian GAN based on the sampling method. The learning efficiency and generation performance are evaluated.},

  abstract = {Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MPE), an extension of Permutation Entropy (PE), was proposed to better capture the information content in long range trends. This technique has been extensively used in biomedical applications for diagnosis purposes. Although PE theory is well established and explored, there is still a lack of theoretical development for MPE. In the present paper, we expand the theory by formulating an explicit MPE model of first order Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) processes, which are well known and used in signal modeling. We first build the autocorrelation function of coarse-grained AR and MA models, which are a prerequisite for MPE calculation. Next, we use the resulting autocorrelation functions to establish the theoretical value of MPE as a function of time scale and AR or MA parameters. The theoretical result is tested against MPE measurements from simulations. We found the MPE of the 1o order AR model to converge to the maximum entropy with increasing time scale. Nonetheless, the convergence is not always monotonic. For AR parameter values greater than the Golden Ratio, the MPE curve presents a local minimum at a time scale different than one, which implies a more regular structure than the one measured with PE. The MPE of the 1o order MA model converges rapidly to the maximum entropy with increasing time scales, regardless of the MA parameter value, which is in accordance to our expectations.},

Since several recoloured candidates are now generated for each pixel in the source image, we define an original procedure to efficiently merge these candidates which allows denoising and artifact removal as well as colour transfer. Experiments show quantitative and qualitative improvements over previous colour transfer methods.

  abstract = {Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a probabilistic approach to estimation problems based on representing sparsity-promoting priors by Normals with Unknown Variances. This representation blends well with linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs). However, in classical SBL the unknown variances are a priori independent, which is not suited for modeling group sparse signals, or signals whose variances have structure. To model signals with, e.g., exponentially decaying or piecewise-constant (in particular block-sparse) variances, we propose SSMs with dynamical and sparse variances (SSM-DSV). These are two-layer SSMs, where the bottom layer models physical signals, and the top layer models dynamical variances that are subject to abrupt changes. Inference and learning in these hierarchical models is performed with a message passing version of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which is a special instance of the more general class of variational message passing algorithms. We validated the proposed model and estimation algorithm with two applications, using both simulated and real data. First, we implemented a block-outlier insensitive Kalman smoother by modeling the disturbance process with a SSM-DSV. Second, we used SSM-DSV to model the oculomotor system and employed EM-message passing for estimating neural controller signals from eye position data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a versatile method that accelerates multichannel source separation methods based on full-rank spatial modeling. A popular approach to multichannel source separation is to integrate a spatial model with a source model for estimating the spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) and power spectral densities (PSDs) of each sound source in the time-frequency domain. One of the most successful examples of this approach is multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) based on a full-rank spatial model and a low-rank source model. MNMF, however, is computationally expensive and often works poorly due to the difficulty of estimating the unconstrained full-rank SCMs. Instead of restricting the SCMs to rank -1 matrices with the severe loss of the spatial modeling ability as in independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), we restrict the SCMs of each frequency bin to jointly-diagonalizable but still full-rank matrices. For such a fast version of MNMF, we propose a computationally-efficient and convergence-guaranteed algorithm that is similar in form to that of ILRMA. Similarly, we propose a fast version of a state of-the-art speech enhancement method based on a deep speech model and a low-rank noise model. Experimental results showed that the fast versions of MNMF and the deep speech enhancement method were several times faster and performed even better than the original versions of those methods, respectively.},

  abstract = {Signal segmentation is a generic task in many time series applications. We propose approaching it via Bayesian changepoint algorithms, i.e., by assigning segments between changepoints. When successive signals show a recurrent change-point pattern, estimating changepoint recurrence is beneficial for two reasons: While recurrent changepoints yield more robust signal segment estimates, non-recurrent changepoints bear valuable information for unsupervised anomaly detection. This study introduces the changepoint recurrence distribution (CPRD) as an empirical estimate of the recurrent behavior of observed changepoints. Two generic methods for incorporating the estimated CPRD into the process of assessing recurrence of future changepoints are suggested. The knowledge of non-recurrent changepoints arising from one of these methods allows additional unsupervised anomaly detection. The quality both of changepoint recurrence estimation via CPRD and of changepoint-related signal segmentation and un-supervised anomaly detection are verified in a proof-of-concept study for two exemplary machine tool monitoring tasks.},

As previously shown, a linear least squares direction estimate can be obtained by minimizing the difference of expected and observed inter-microphone phase differences. In this work, it is shown that phase wrapping induces severe estimation errors especially at frequencies just below spatial aliasing frequencies and in low signal-to-noise ratios. A cost function to mitigate the influence of phase wrapping errors on the DOA estimation is proposed. Even though the proposed cost function is nonlinear, it is shown that one iteration of a gradient descent method with proper initialization provides a large improvement when compared to the linear least squares solution.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {We revisit the problem of blind calibration of uniform linear sensors arrays for narrowband signals and set the premises for the derivation of the optimal blind calibration scheme. In particular, instead of taking the direct (rather involved) Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for joint estimation of all the unknown model parameters, we follow Paulraj and Kailath's classical approach in exploiting the special (Toeplitz) structure of the observed covariance. However, we offer a substantial improvement over Paulraj and Kailath's Least Squares (LS) estimate by using asymptotic approximations in order to obtain simple, (quasi-)linear Weighted LS (WLS) estimates of the sensors' gains and phases offsets with asymptotically optimal weighting. As we show in simulation experiments, our WLS estimates exhibit near-optimal performance, with a considerable improvement (reaching an order of magnitude and more) in the resulting mean squared errors, w.r.t. the corresponding ordinary LS estimates. We also briefly explain how the methodology derived in this work may be utilized in order to obtain (by certain modifications) the asymptotically optimal ML estimates w.r.t. the raw data via a (quasi)-linear WLS estimate.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a replay attack detection method using the generalized cross-correlation (GCC) of a stereo signal for automatic speaker verification. In particular, this method focuses on a specific replay attack characteristics when speech is not active. In a genuine speaker case, when speech is not active, the maximum value of GCC is low since surrounding noise arrives from any direction. In contrast, in a replay attack case, even when the played speech is not active, the maximum value of GCC is high since recorded noise or electromagnetic noise is played by a loudspeaker for replay attack. Based on this assumption, two approaches of replay attack detection are introduced. One is to use the minimum value of GCC in short pauses. The other one is to use the average value of GCC in silent periods before the start point and after the end point of a target utterance. In experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed methods achieve low error rates without environmental restrictions.},

  abstract = {Features extracted from respiratory activity signals have been shown to carry information about mental states such as anxiety and mental stress. Such findings, however, are based on studies conducted mostly in controlled laboratory environments with artificially-induced psychological responses. While this assures that high quality data are collected, the amount of data is limited and the transferability of the findings to more ecologically-appropriate natural settings (i.e., “in-the-wild”) remains unknown. In this paper, we propose new non-linear complexity measures computed from four different respiration activity time series (i.e., inter-breath interval, inhale-to-exhale ratio, inhale/exhale amplitude envelope, and interbreath difference) and show their discriminatory power for anxiety and stress monitoring in the workplace. The new features are tested on a dataset collected from 200 hospital workers (nurses and staff) during their normal work shifts. The proposed features are shown to be complementary to conventional measures of breathing rate and depth.},

For the deterministic case, an exact closed-form expression for the distribution of the joint likelihood statistic is provided whereas, in the random case, an exact expression of its asymptotic distribution is derived. In both cases, the computed distribution of the likelihood statistic enables the joint estimation of the channel parameters and the detection of the IN support with guarantees on the false alarm probability for the samples that are estimated to be in the IN support set. The goodness of the proposed expressions is validated via numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The concept of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) with Cognitive Radio (CR) as a key enabler is considered as a promising solution to alleviate the inefficient use of the radio spectrum. Relying on the presumed knowledge of the spectrum occupancy from sensing, geo-location databases or prediction, DSA allows opportunistic users to share spectrum bands in a non-interfering manner when the bands are not in use by their respective incumbent owners. Several literatures have presented prediction algorithms in order to get meaningful data about future spectrum usage; however, most of them only exploit the spectrum data in time, space and/or frequency dimension(s) to provide a short term, i.e., single next step, prediction. In this work, we propose a novel approach with Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Deep Learning Neural Network for a long-term temporal prediction that is trained to learn joint spatial-spectral-temporal dependencies observed in spectrum usage. Real environment measurement data from Electrosense are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed network for increasing future time steps and different spectrum channels. Prediction result for the next 180 minutes for UHF bands of 450-520 MHz is presented for a 4 km2 area in Spain indicating the prominent and stable prediction performance of ConvLSTM network.},

When applied to our data, results show that the SegNet method outperforms the three other methods with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) equal to 97.26%.

  abstract = {One of the key issues of multi-sensory digital healthcare and therapy is the reliability and user compliance of the applied sensor system. In the context of digital gait analysis and rehabilitation, different technologies have been proposed allowing objective gait assessment and precise quantification of the rehabilitation progress using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) platforms. However, this depends largely on the estimation accuracy of the kinematics (body joint angles). This paper presents the concept of a digital equivalent based on the Memory Polynomial Model (MPM) to reduce the number of IMUs needed for the measurements and to simulate the physical mechanism of lower body joint angles based on acceleration data. The MPM parameter estimation is based on the Least Square (LS) approach and is performed using accelerometer records of non-pathological gait patterns. The Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. According to the results an NMSE of -20 dB is achieved, which indicates the great potential of applying the MPM to develop a digital twin. That kind of twin can serve as a prototype of the physical counterpart to improve the wearability of the sensor system and to reduce physically induced measurement errors as well.},

Due to the chosen filter size, M -1 convolution layers are required to achieve the best performance for a microphone array with M microphones. For arrays with large number of microphones, this requirement leads to a high computational cost making the method practically infeasible. In this work, we propose to expand the receptive field of the filters to reduce the computational cost of our previously proposed method. To realize this expansion, we use systematic dilations of the filters in each of the convolution layers. Different systematic dilation strategies for a specific microphone array are explored. Experimental analysis of the different strategies, shows that an aggressive expansion strategy results in a considerable reduction in computational cost while a relatively gradual expansion of the receptive field exhibits the best DOA estimation performance along with reduction in the computational cost.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and its mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Analyzing atrial epicardial electrograms (EGMs) is important to understand the mechanisms underlying AF. However, when measuring the atrial activity (AA), the electrogram is commonly distorted by the far-field ventricular activity (VA). During sinus rhythm, the AA and the VA are separated in time. However, the VA often overlaps with the AA in both time and frequency domain during AF, complicating proper analysis of the AA. Unlike traditional methods, this work explores graph signal processing (GSP) tools for AA extraction in EGMs. Since EGMs are time-varying and non-stationary, we put forward the joint graph and short-time Fourier transform to analyze the graph signal along both time and vertices. It is found that the temporal frequency components of the AA and the VA exhibit different levels of spatial variation over the graph in the joint domain. Subsequently, we exploit these findings to propose a novel algorithm for extracting the AA based on graph smoothness. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that the smoothness analysis of the EGMs over the atrial area enables us to better extract the AA.},

  abstract = {We study the joint low-rank factorization of the matrices X=[A B]G and Y=[A C]H, in which the columns of the shared factor matrix A correspond to vectorized rank-one matrices, the unshared factors B and C have full column rank, and the matrices G and H have full row rank. The objective is to find the shared factor A, given only X and Y. We first explain that if the matrix [A B C] has full column rank, then a basis for the column space of the shared factor matrix A can be obtained from the null space of the matrix [X Y]. This in turn implies that the problem of finding the shared factor matrix A boils down to a basic Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) problem that in many cases can directly be solved by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. Next, we explain that by taking the rank-one constraint of the columns of the shared factor matrix A into account when computing the null space of the matrix [X Y], more relaxed identifiability conditions can be obtained that do not require that [A B C] has full column rank. The benefit of the unconstrained null space approach is that it leads to simple algorithms while the benefit of the rank-one constrained null space approach is that it leads to relaxed identifiability conditions. Finally, a joint unbalanced orthogonal Procrustes and CPD fitting approach for computing the shared factor matrix A from noisy observation matrices X and Y will briefly be discussed.},

  abstract = {Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to develop seizures but humans overlook such brief events in an electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally, training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work, we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a consensustrained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection. The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort from consensusoriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the event and the labeler category.},

However, neural distillation does not always lead to consistent results, with several factors affecting the efficiency of the knowledge distillation process. In this paper it is experimentally demonstrated that the selected teacher can indeed have a significant effect on knowledge transfer. To overcome this limitation, we propose a curriculum-based teacher ensemble that allows for performing robust and efficient knowledge distillation. The proposed method is motivated by the way that humans learn through a curriculum, as well as supported by recent findings that hints to the existence of critical learning periods in neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to various distillation variants, is demonstrated using three image datasets and different network architectures.},

The error rate averaged over all conditions was 1.4% when using multi-condition training and decreased to 0.8% by employing feature augmentation. The use of FSR feature compensation, specific to weight variability, resulted in 0.24% error rate.},

A deep autoencoder network is trained to compress, quantize and reconstruct the bit log-likelihood ratios corresponding to a single transmitted symbol. Specifically, the encoder maps to a latent space with dimension equal to the number of sufficient statistics required to recover the inputs - equal to three in this case - while the decoder aims to reconstruct a noisy version of the latent representation with the purpose of modeling quantization effects in a differentiable way. Simulation results show that, when applied to a standard rate-1/2 low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, a finite precision compression factor of nearly three times is achieved when storing an entire codeword, with an incurred loss of performance lower than 0.15 dB compared to straightforward scalar quantization of the log-likelihood ratios and the method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.},

Our innovation is to improve context-awareness of speech variability by introducing multiple auxiliary networks into the neural VAD framework. While previous studies reported that phonetic-aware auxiliary features extracted from a phoneme recognition network can improve VAD performance, none examined other effective auxiliary features for enhancing noise robustness. Thus, this paper present a neural VAD that uses auxiliary features extracted from not only the phoneme recognition network but also a speech enhancement network and an acoustic scene classification network. The last two networks are expected to improve context-awareness even in extremely low SNR environments since they can extract de-noised speech awareness and noisy environment awareness. In addition, we expect that combining these multiple auxiliary features yield synergistic improvements in VAD performance. Experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method in very low SNR environments.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with a multichannel audio source separation problem under underdetermined conditions. Multi-channel Non-negative Matrix Factorization (MNMF) is one of the powerful approaches, which adopts the NMF concept for source power spectrogram modeling. It works reasonably well for particular types of sound sources, however, one limitation is that it can fail to work for sources with spectrograms that do not comply with the NMF model. To address this limitation, a novel technique called the Multichannel Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) method was recently proposed, where a Conditional VAE (CVAE) is used instead of the NMF model for source power spectrogram modeling. This approach has shown to perform impressively in determined source separation tasks thanks to the representation power of DNNs. This paper generalizes MVAE originally formulated under determined mixing conditions so that it can also deal with underdetermined cases. The proposed method was evaluated on an underdetermined source separation task of separating out three sources from two microphone inputs. Experimental results revealed that the generalized MVAE method achieved better performance than the conventional MNMF method.},

  abstract = {Brain functioning is severely affected in long-term alcoholics. This degradation is reflected in Electroencephalographic signals(EEG) which are electrical signals in the brain generated due to the firing of neurons. These signals can be used to understand the changes in the brain of an alcoholic. In this work, Riemann geometry based classification framework is used to study changes in interdependencies across various brain regions in alcoholics. Publicly available data of 50 subjects(25 alcoholics, 25 control) with 10 trials each are used in this work. Spatial covariance matrices for empirically chosen channels are input to two classification scenarios. In the first scenario, covariance matrices are used as features to ”Minimum Distance to Mean classifier with geodesic filtering(fgMDM)” on the manifold. The highest mean accuracy obtained is 82.8% for the channel set of AF2 & P6. In the second scenario, the covariance matrices are mapped to tangent space and the resultant tangent vectors are used as features for Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel. In this scenario, the highest mean accuracy obtained is 87.6% for the channel set FP1 & PO1. Both scenarios indicate significant changes across frontal lobe in comparison to the posterior lobes of the brain, in alcoholics. Changes in covariance matrices for the EEG, when the same stimulus is provided, indicate changes in brain functioning, consistent with alcoholism. Hence, Riemann geometry is a promising framework to study changes in brain region inter-dependencies, for subjects exposed to different brain-altering situations.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The development of models for quality prediction of both audio and video signals is a fairly mature field. But, although several multimodal models have been proposed, the area of audio-visual quality prediction is still an emerging area. In fact, despite the reasonable performance obtained by combination and parametric metrics, currently there is no reliable pixel-based audio-visual quality metric. The approach presented in this work is based on the assumption that autoencoders, fed with descriptive audio and video features, might produce a set of features that is able to describe the complex audio and video interactions. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a No-Reference AudioVisual Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd). The model visual features are natural scene statistics (NSS) and spatial-temporal measures of the video component. Meanwhile, the audio features are obtained by computing the spectrogram representation of the audio component. The model is formed by a 2-layer framework that includes a deep autoencoder layer and a classification layer. These two layers are stacked and trained to build the deep neural network model. The model is trained and tested using a large set of stimuli, containing representative audio and video artifacts. The model performed well when tested against the UnB-AV and the LiveNetflix-II databases.},

  abstract = {The autoregressive (AR) model is a widely used model to represent the time series data from numerous applications, for example, financial time series, DNA microarray data, etc. In all such applications, issues with missing values frequently occur in the data observation or recording process. Traditionally, the parameter estimation for AR models of order p (AR(p)), from data with missing values has been considered under the Gaussian innovation assumption, and there does not exist any work addressing the issue of missing data for the heavy-tailed AR(p) model. This paper proposes an efficient framework for the parameter estimation from incomplete heavy-tailed AR(p) time series based on the stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. The proposed algorithm is computationally cheap and easy to implement. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

ASMLR performs well on hyperspectral images, and CNNs are known to give good results in many applications such as image classification and object recognition. Thus, the proposed technique allows us to improve the performance of CNNs by training the whole network with an end-to-end framework. This approach takes advantage of convolutional layers for spectral feature extraction, and of the softmax classification layer for feature selection with sparsity constraints, and an intrinsic learning rate adjustment mechanism. In classification, we also use a spatial smoothing method. The proposed method was evaluated on two hyperspectral images for spectral-spatial land cover classification, and the results have shown that it outperforms the CNN and the ASMLR classifiers when they are used separately.},

  abstract = {Video codec heavily relies on motion compensated prediction to achieve compression efficiency. The predictive scheme creates temporal dependency across frames, i.e., the quantization distortion in a current block may propagate through motion compensated prediction and affect the coding efficiency of blocks in subsequent frames. The ability to capture such dependency can potentially improve the rate-distortion optimization for coding performance gains. Prior research work builds block-based motion trajectories and uses the correlations between source pixel blocks in the same motion trajectory to estimate the distortion propagation model. This work premises on the realization that the distortion propagation is also largely related to the quantization effect. A novel temporal dependency model that accounts for both block correlation and the quantization effect is proposed. It is experimentally shown to provide considerable compression gains over the existing competitors.},

It is crucial that the input-decimation technique is presented to decrease the number of input sequences for the recursive filter so that the computation cycle of RIDFT can be shortened to meet the computing time requirement (3.6 μs). Therefore, the input-decimation RIDFT algorithm is able to carry out at least 55.5% reduction of the total computation cycles compared with the considered algorithms. Holding the advantages of input-decimation technique, the computational complexities of the real-multiplication and -addition are reduced to 41.3% and 22.2%, respectively. Finally, the physical implementation results show that the core area is 0.37× 0.37mm2 with 0.18 μm CMOS process.

  abstract = {Many interesting matrix decompositions/factorizations, and especially many tensor decompositions, have to be solved by non-convex optimization-based algorithms, that may converge to local optima. Hence, when interpretability of the components is a requirement, practitioners have to compute the decomposition (e.g. CPD) many times, with different initializations, to verify whether the components are reproducible over repetitions of the optimization. However, it is non-trivial to assess such reliability or stability when multiple local optima are encountered. We propose an efficient algorithm that clusters the different repetitions of the decomposition according to the local optimum that they belong to, offering a diagnostic tool to practitioners. Our algorithm employs a graph-based representation of the decomposition, in which every repetition corresponds to a node, and similarities between components are encoded as edges. Clustering is then performed by exploiting a property known as cycle consistency, leading to a low-rank approximation of the graph. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on realistic electroencephalographic (EEG) data and synthetic data.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Versatile Video Coding (VVC) is the next generation video coding standard expected by the end of 2020. VVC introduces several new coding tools that enable better coding performance compared to the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. The Multiple Transform Selection (MTS) concept, as introduced in VVC, relies on three trigonometrical transforms, and at the encoder side, selects the couple of horizontal and vertical transforms that maximises the RateDistortion cost. However, the new Discrete Sine Transform (DST)VII and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-VIII do not have fast computing algorithms and rely on matrix multiplication, which requires high hardware resources especially for large block sizes.This paper tackles the hardware implementation of an approximation of MTS module. This approximation consists in applying adjustment stages, based on sparse block-band matrices, to a variants of DCT-II family mainly DCT-II and its inverse. Therefore, an efficient 2D hardware implementation of the forward and inverse approximate transform module is proposed. The architecture design includes a pipelined and reconfigurable forward-inverse DCT-II core transform. A unified 2D implementation of 16 and 32-point forward-inverse DCTII, approximate DST-VII and DCT-VIII is also presented. The synthesis results show that the design is able to sustain 2K and 4K videos at 377 and 94 frames per second, respectively, while using only 18% of Alms, 40% of registers and 34% of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks of the ArrialO SoC platform.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a multi-microphone speech separation algorithm based on masking inferred from the speakers direction of arrival (DOA). According to the W-disjoint orthogonality property of speech signals, each time-frequency (TF) bin is dominated by a single speaker. This TF bin can therefore be associated with a single DOA. In our procedure, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) with a U-net architecture to infer the DOA of each TF bin from a concatenated set of the spectra of the microphone signals. Separation is obtained by multiplying the reference microphone by the masks associated with the different DOAs. Our proposed deep direction estimation for speech separation (DDESS) method is inspired by the recent advances in deep clustering methods. Unlike already established methods that apply the clustering in a latent embedded space, in our approach the embedding is closely associated with the spatial information, as manifested by the different speakers' directions of arrival.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In mmWave communications, large-scale arrays can be very advantageous. In such arrays, switch-based hybrid precoding (beamforming) is very promising in terms of energy efficiency and reduced complexity, as opposed to phase-shifter structures for beamforming. However, switch-based structures are binary, which means that the design of an optimum beamformer, at large-scale in the analog domain, is a difficult task. We address this problem and propose a new method for the design of a switch-based hybrid precoder for massive MIMO communications in mmWave bands. We first cast the relevant maximization of mutual information as a binary, rank-constrained quadratic maximization, and solve it iteratively for each column of the analog precoder. The solution is then effectively approximated via a set of relaxations and sequential convex programming (SCP). Finally, we show the feasibility, and effectiveness of our method via numerical results.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in the estimation of the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of discrete random vectors (RVs) from partial observations thereof (namely when observed realizations of the RV are limited to random subsets of its elements). It was shown that under a low-rank assumption on the PMF tensor (and some additional mild conditions), the full tensor can be recovered, e.g., by applying an approximate coupled factorization to empirical estimates of all joint PMFs of subgroups of fixed cardinality larger than two (e.g., triplets). The coupled factorization is based on a Least Squares (LS) fit to the empirically estimated lower-order sub-tensors. In this work we take a different approach by trying to fit the coupled factorization to estimated sub-tensors in the sense of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and inferred tensors. We explain why the KLD-based fitting is better-suited than LS-based fitting for the problem of PMF estimation, propose an associated minimization approach and demonstrate some advantages over LS-based fitting in this context using simulation results.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {This paper presents an effective method to address the inverse problem of Mel-frequency cepstral analysis, and describes how to reconstruct the speech waveforms from Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) directly. To exploit the sparse characteristics of speech in the frequency domain, an iteratively reweighted ℓ2 minimization method is proposed to cope with the under-determined nature of the reconstruction problem. The lost phase information during Mel-frequency cepstral analysis procedure is recovered by the inverse shorttime Fourier transform magnitude algorithm. Experiments are conducted over the TIMIT database and evaluated by several different kinds of measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method recovers speech with high articulation and intelligibility. Specifically, it sounds very close to the original speech when using the high-resolution MFCCs, the average STOI, PESQ score reaches 93% and 4.0, respectively. This method could be easily used for MFCC codec at low bit rate.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is widely used to estimate the Hurst exponent. Although it can be outperformed by wavelet based approaches, it remains popular because it does not require a strong expertise in signal processing. Recently, some studies were dedicated to its theoretical analysis and its limits. More particularly, some authors focused on the so-called fluctuation function by searching a relation with an estimation of the normalized covariance function under some assumptions. This paper is complementary to these works. We first show that the square of the fluctuation function can be expressed in a similar matrix form for the DFA and the variant we propose, called Continuous-DFA (CDFA), where the global trend is constrained to be continuous. Then, using the above representation for wide-sense-stationary processes, the statistical mean of the square of the fluctuation function can be expressed from the correlation function of the signal and consequently from its power spectral density, without any approximation. The differences between both methods can be highlighted. It also confirms that they can be seen as ad hocwavelet based techniques.},

Recently, authors have proposed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architecture (namely, DiscoGAN) to discover such cross-domain relationships for whisper-to-normal speech (WHSP2SPCH) conversion. In this paper, we extend this study with detailed theory and analysis. In addition, Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) is also proposed for the cross-domain WHSP2SPCH conversion. We observe that the proposed systems yield objective results that are comparable to the baseline, and are superior in terms of fundamental frequency (i.e.,F0) prediction. Moreover, we observe that the proposed cross-domain architectures have been preferred 55.75% (on average) times more compared to the traditional GAN in the subjective evaluations. This reveals that the proposed method yields a more natural-sounding normal speech converted from whispered speech.},

  abstract = {We present a method for detecting early signs of Parkinson's disease from keystroke hold times that is based on the Tensor-Train (TT) decomposition. While simple uni-variate methods such as logistic regression have shown good performance on the given problem by using appropriate features, the TT format facilitates modelling high-order interactions by representing the exponentially large parameter tensor in a compact multi-linear form. By performing time-series feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis testing, we show that the proposed approach can significantly improve upon state-of-the-art for the given problem, reaching a performance of AUC=0.88, outperforming compared methods such as deep neural networks on the problem of detecting early Parkinson's disease from keystroke dynamics.},

  title = {Analysis of Parkinson’s Disease Dysgraphia Based on Optimized Fractional Order Derivative Features},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with prevalence rate estimated to 1.5 % for people age over 65 years. The majority of PD patients is associated with handwriting abnormalities called PD dysgraphia, which is linked with rigidity and bradykinesia of muscles involved in the handwriting process. One of the effective approaches of quantitative PD dysgraphia analysis is based on online handwriting processing. In the frame of this study we aim to deeply evaluate and optimize advanced PD handwriting quantification based on fractional order derivatives (FD). For this purpose, we used 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls from the PaHaW (PD handwriting database). The FD based features were employed in classification and regression analysis (using gradient boosted trees), and evaluated in terms of their discrimination power and abilities to assess severity of PD. The results suggest that the most discriminative and descriptive information provide FD based features extracted from a repetitive loop task or a sentence copy task (maximum sensitivity/specificity = 76 %, error in severity assessment = 14 %, error in PD duration estimation = 22 %). Next, we identified two optimal ranges for the order of fractional derivative, α = 0.05-0.45 and α = 0.65-0.80. Finally, we observed that inclusion of pressure, azimuth, and tilt together with kinematic features into mathematical modeling has no influence (positive or negative) on classification performance, however, there was a notable improvement in the estimation of PD duration.},

In this article we describe an automatic system which combines text clinical annotations, demographical information, as well as different types of ophthalmology image data to issue a recommendation for cataract surgery. Textual annotations are encoded using a standardized medical ontology nomenclature to enable higher level modeling. Image data is processed by convolutional neural networks to extract compact features. These two types of data together with demographical information are then inputted into a random forest classifier which then decides if surgery is recommended. The method proposed is evaluated on a real-life dataset, achieving accuracies and precisions around 90%. Several conclusions are drawn concerning the usefulness of the different input data types, used independently or combined.},

  abstract = {There is a rising interest in studying the degree of connection and the causal relationships between brain regions, as a growing body of evidence suggests that features of these interactions could play a role as markers in a host of neurological diseases. The vast majority of brain connectivity studies treats the brain network as stationary. New insights on the temporal behaviour of these connections could significantly improve our understanding of brain networking in both physiology and pathology. In this paper, we propose the application of a computational methodology, named Particle Filter (PF), to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The PF algorithm aims to estimate time-varying hidden variables of a given observational model through a Sequential Monte Carlo approach. The fMRI data are represented as a first-order linear time-varying Vector Autoregression model (VAR). On simulated time series, the PF approach effectively detected and enabled to follow time-varying hidden parameters and it captured causal relationships among signals. The method was also applied to real fMRI data and provided similar results to those obtained by using a different proxy measure of causal dependency, that is, correlation between delayed time series. Interestingly, the PF approach also enabled to detect statistically significant changes in the cause-effect relationships between areas, which correlated with the underlying stimulation pattern delivered to subjects during the fMRI acquisition.},

The proposed processing scheme is based on modelling SAR sea backscattering assuming a Generalized Gamma Distribution clutter. The signal processing scheme includes a first stage to define the non-homogeneous area due to the presence of dark spots in function of the multi-scale estimations of a textural parameter defined as the inverse of the product between shape and scale sea clutter parameters. After an statistical study of this parameter, a robust value can be defined for comparison purposes. In the resulted search area, an adaptive thresholding is performed to obtain a segmented image with the oil slicks candidates contouring at pixel level.

Experiments are performed both on a desktop computer and on a mobile platform using a CNN model for vehicle type classification.

  abstract = {Denoising algorithms via sparse representation are among the state-of-the art for 2D image restoration. In this work, we propose a novel sparse and prior-based algorithm for 3D image denoising (SPADE). SPADE is a modification of total variation (TV) problem with an additional functional that promotes sparsity with respect to a prior image. The prior is obtained from the noisy image by combining information from neighbor slices. The functional is minimized using the split Bregman method, which leads to an efficient method for large scale 3D denoising, with computational cost given by three FFT per iteration. SPADE is compared to TV and dictionary learning on the Shepp-Logan phantom and on human knee data acquired on a spectral computerized tomography scanner. SPADE converges in approximately ten iterations and provides comparable or better results than the other methods. In addition, the exploitation of the prior image avoids the patchy, cartoon-like images provided by TV and provides a more natural texture.},

  abstract = {Robust feature compensation and selection are important aspects of noisy speech emotion recognition (SER) task, especially in mismatched condition, when the models are trained on clean speech and tested in the noisy scenarios. Here we propose the use of front-end feature compensation techniques based on Vector Taylor Series (VTS) expansion and VTS with auditory masking (VTS-AM) to improve the performance of SER systems. On top of VTS and VTS-AM, we compare the performances of log-compression and root-compression to the mel-filter-bank energies. Further, we demonstrate the benefit of feature selection applied to the non-MFCC high-level descriptors in conjunction with VTS, VTS-AM and root compression. The system performance is compared with popular Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based enhancement and energy based voice activity detector (VAD) technique, which discards silence or noisy frames in the spoken utterances. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques, extensive experiments are conducted on 2 standard datasets (EmoDB and IEMOCAP), contaminated with 5 types of noise (Babble, F-16, Factory, Volvo, and HF-channel) from the Noisex -92 noise database at 5 SNR levels (0dB, 5dB, 10dB, 15dB and 20dB).},

The work herein presented explores the performance of Deep Learning in the field of astrophysics, when conducted on a distributed environment. To set up such an environment, we capitalize on TensorFlowOnSpark, which combines both TensorFlow's dataflow graphs and Spark's cluster management. We report on the performance of a CPU cluster, considering both the number of training nodes and data distribution, while quantifying their effects via the metrics of training accuracy and training loss. Our results indicate that distribution has a positive impact on Deep Learning, since it accelerates our network's convergence for a given number of epochs.

  abstract = {In this paper we deal with the problem of hyperspectral X-Ray image denoising. In particular, we compare a classical model-based Wiener filter solution with a datadriven methodology based on a Convolutional Autoencoder. A challenging aspect is related to the specific kind of 2D signal we are processing: it presents mixed dimensions information since on the vertical axis there is the pixels position while, on the abscissa, there are the different wavelengths associated to the acquired X-Ray spectrum. The goal is to approximate the denoising function using a learning-from-data approach and to verify its capability to emulate the Wiener filter using a much less demanding approach in terms of signal and noise statistical knowledge. We show that, after training, the CNN is able to properly restore the 2D signal with results very close to the Wiener filter, honouring the proper signal shape.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a low-rank tensor minimization algorithm to recover a spectral image (SI) from a set of compressed observations. The proposal takes advantage of the transform tensor singular value decomposition (tt-SVD) to promote a low-rank structure on the recovered SI. The methodology has three stages. First, a poor low-rank version of the SI is estimated using the tt-SVD framework with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Then, an orthogonal transform is learned from the initial estimation using dictionary learning. Finally, an algorithm to find a low-rank approximation of the SI in both, the DCT and the learned transform is introduced. Quantitative evaluation over two databases and two compressive optical systems shows that the proposed method improves the reconstruction quality in up to 10dB as well as it is robust in the presence of noise.},

  abstract = {Traditional target detection techniques have been developed using measurements from the object acquired by optical systems that are only able to measure its intensity, losing its optical phase information. The optical phase, for instance, allows describing the shape and depth of an object. This work proposes a target identification methodology that operates over measurements acquired through an optical system that collects coded diffraction patterns (CDP). In contrast to traditional detection techniques, the proposed methodology is able to incorporate the optical phase information of an object as a discriminant in the target detection task. The proposed methodology consists of two steps: first, an estimation of the scene from the acquired CDP is accomplished, second, a scanning procedure with a reference pattern over the estimated scene is performed. Numerical results show that the phase information can be used as an identification discriminant for target detection. Also, simulations demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to identify a target under highly noisy scenarios using one single snapshot with a success rate up of 84%. Furthermore, it is worth to mention that to the best of our knowledge this is the first methodology that uses the optical phase of an object as a target identification discriminant.},

In this paper, the reverse mode behavior is investigated through the analysis of its influence on urban sound classification accuracy by comparing the results of deep learning based classifiers. As no audio datasets recorded by loudspeakers are available, a popular traditional dataset was used and transformed into forms as they would have been recorded by reverse mode speakers. These transformations simulated the loudspeakers' electrical responses to acoustical excitation signals based on their reverse mode transfer functions, which were derived from equivalent mechanical circuits. The details of this reverse mode modeling are also included. The transformed datasets were used during the trainings of the classifiers, and the effects of different speaker parameters and noise levels were examined and compared. The results showed that smaller, full-range speakers performed better than bigger woofers. The types of well-classified events revealed that loud, impulsive events could be classified more accurately.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) through the lens of edge-variant graph filters. The edge-variant graph filter is a finite order, linear, and local recursion that allows each node, in each iteration, to weigh differently the information of its neighbors. By exploiting this recursion, we put forth a general framework for GCNNs which considers state-of-the-art solutions as particular cases. This framework results useful to i) understand the tradeoff between local detail and the number of parameters of each solution and ii) provide guidelines for developing a myriad of novel approaches that can be implemented locally in the vertex domain. One of such approaches is presented here showing superior performance w.r.t. current alternatives in graph signal classification problems.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral (HS) imaging systems are useful in a diverse range of applications that involve detection and classification tasks. However, the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral images may limit the performance of the involved tasks in such applications. In the last years, fusing the information of a HS image with high spatial resolution multispectral (MS) or panchromatic (PAN) images has been widely studied to enhance the spatial resolution. Image fusion has been formulated as an inverse problem whose solution is a HS image which assumed to be sparse in an analytic or learned dictionary. This work proposes a non-local centralized sparse representation model on a set of learned dictionaries in order to regularize the conventional fusion problem. The dictionaries are learned from the observed data taking advantage of the high spectral correlation within the HS image and the non-local self-similarity over the spatial domain of the MS image. Then, conditionally on these dictionaries, the fusion problem is solved by an alternating iterative numerical algorithm. Experimental results with real data show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different quantitative assessments.},

  abstract = {Developing techniques for adversarial attack and defense is an important research field for establishing reliable machine learning and its applications. Many existing methods employ Gaussian random variables for exploring the data space to find the most adversarial (for attacking) or least adversarial (for defense) point. However, the Gaussian distribution is not necessarily the optimal choice when the exploration is required to follow the complicated structure that most real-world data distributions exhibit. In this paper, we investigate how statistics of random variables affect such random walk exploration. Specifically, we generalize the Boundary Attack, a state-of-the-art blackbox decision based attacking strategy, and propose the Le'vy-Attack, where the random walk is driven by symmetric α-stable random variables. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets show that the Le'vy-Attack explores the image data space more efficiently, and significantly improves the performance. Our results also give an insight into the recently found fact in the whitebox attacking scenario that the choice of the norm for measuring the amplitude of the adversarial patterns is essential.},

While these innovative and ground-breaking applications can be considered as a boon, at the same time they raise significant privacy concerns. In fact, recent GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) legislation has highlighted and become an incentive for privacy-preserving solutions. Typical privacy-preserving video monitoring schemes address these concerns by either anonymizing the sensitive data. However, these approaches suffer from some limitations, since they are usually non-reversible, do not provide multiple levels of decryption and computationally costly. In this paper, we provide a novel privacy-preserving method, which is reversible, supports de-identification at multiple privacy levels, and can efficiently perform data acquisition, encryption and data hiding by combining multi-level encryption with compressive sensing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in protecting the identity of the users has been validated using the goodness of reconstruction quality and strong anonymization of the faces.},

We apply this optimization strategy to the example of a cascade of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. While the design of cascaded FIR filters generally focuses on low-level details, we provide a highlevel model. This development strategy can be generalized for any signal processing chain made by assembling blocks whose resource consumption is qualified: a solver aims at meeting multiple objectives including minimizing resource consumption or optimizing performance. This result is then transformed into a synthesizable solution targeting a reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The experiments show that this approach gives efficient results, both on the quality of the signal filtering and the processing resource used for the design.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a distributed solution to the navigation of a population of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to best localize a static source. The network is considered heterogeneous with UAVs equipped with received signal strength (RSS) sensors from which it is possible to estimate the distance from the source and/or the direction of arrival through adhoc rotations. This diversity in gathering and processing RSS measurements mitigates the loss of localization accuracy due to the adoption of low-complexity sensors. The UAVs plan their trajectories on-the-fly and in a distributed fashion. The collected data are disseminated through the network via multi-hops, therefore being subject to latency. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering rewards, the motion planning is formulated as a minimization of the uncertainty of the source position under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints and performed by 3D non-linear programming. The proposed analysis takes into account non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions as well as measurement age caused by the latency constraints in communication.},

  abstract = {The estimation of the atrial activity (AA) signal in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings is an important step in the noninvasive analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Recently, this blind source separation (BSS) problem has been formulated as a tensor factorization, based on the block term decomposition (BTD) of a data tensor built from Hankel matrices of the observed ECG. However, this tensor factorization technique was precisely assessed only in segments with long R-R intervals and with the AA well defined in the TQ segment, where ventricular activity (VA) is absent. Due to the chaotic nature of AA in AF, segments with disorganized or weak AA and with short R-R intervals are quite more common in persistent AF, posing some difficulties to the BSS methods to extract the AA signal, regarding performance and computational cost. In this paper, the BTD built from Löwner matrices is proposed as a method to separate VA from AA in these challenging scenarios. Experimental results obtained in a population of 10 patients show that the Löwner-based BTD outperforms the Hankel-based BTD and two well-known matrix-based methods in terms of atrial signal estimation quality and computational cost.},

  abstract = {The non invasive analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF) arrhythmia represents a challenge nowadays. The fibrillatory pattern of AF, known as f-wave, is partially masked by the ventricular activity of the heartbeat in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Classical techniques aiming to extract the f-wave are based on average beat subtraction (ABS) or blind source separation (BSS). They present limitations in performance and require long ECG records as well as multi-channel records in the case of BSS. The originality of the present work consists in exploiting the sparsity of the atrial activity (AA) signal in the frequency domain to extract the fullf-wave using a recent data acquisition technique called compressed sensing (CS). The present contribution takes a step forward in the extraction of the f-wave by exploiting the time rather than the space dimension. We intend to recover the AA signal with a variant of CS where classical random sampling is replaced by a block sampling scheme. Our breakthrough finding consists in the ability of our method to accurately extract the AA from a short ECG record of just one heartbeat, with a normalized mean squared error of 15%, which is unfeasible with ABS, BSS and other variants that require longer observation windows.},

The proposed approach has a computational cost equivalent to that of standard NMF and, additionally, has the flexibility to control the degree of interpolation in the missing data regions. Existing WNMF methods do not offer this capability and, thereby, tend to overestimate the values in the masked regions. By constraining the estimates of the missing-data regions, the proposed approach allows for a better trade-off in the interpolation. We further demonstrate the applicability of WNMF and missing data estimation to the problem of speech enhancement. In this preliminary work, we consider the improvement obtainable by applying the proposed method to ideal binary mask-based gain functions. The instrumental quality metrics (PESQ and SNR) clearly indicate the added benefit of the missing data interpolation, compared to the output of the ideal binary mask. This preliminary work opens up novel possibilities not only in the field of speech enhancement but also, more generally, in the field of missing data interpolation using NMF.},

Our proposed mechanism permits Secondary Users (SUs) to establish a bidirectional communication over the same frequency band while keeping aware of the Primary User (PU) activity status. The activity period of SU in our proposed mechanism is composed of two stages: In the first stage SU communicates in bidirectional way with his peer SU. At the second stage, one of the SUs becomes silent in order to do not disturb his peer, which performs a spectrum sensing and remains active at the same time using self-interference cancellation technique. The probability of collision related to our mechanism is derived as well as the probability of waste and the average throughput. Our simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can significantly decrease the probability of collision at low SNRp (Signal to Noise Ratio of PU at SU).},

  abstract = {Gesture recognition has multiple applications in medicine, engineering and robotics. It also allows us to develop new and more natural approaches to human-machine interaction. Real-time hand gesture recognition consists of identifying, with no perceivable delay, a given gesture performed by the hand at any moment. In this paper, we propose a model for real-time hand gesture recognition. The proposed model takes as input electromyographic (EMG) signals measured on the forearm, using the commercial sensor Myo Armband. We use an autoencoder for automatic feature extraction, and an artificial feed-forward neural network for classification. The proposed model can recognize the same 5 gestures as the proprietary recognition system of the Myo Armband, achieving an average recognition accuracy of 85.08% ± 15.21%, with an average response time of 3 ± 1 ms. The proposed model is general, which implies that it can recognize the gestures from any user, even when his\her data are not included in the training dataset. Finally, for reproducing this work, we make publicly available the code that implements the proposed model.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method to use deep neural networks as end-to-end open-set classifiers. It is based on intraclass data splitting. In open-set recognition, only samples from a limited number of known classes are available for training. During inference, an open-set classifier must reject samples from unknown classes while correctly classifying samples from known classes. The proposed method splits given data into typical and atypical normal subsets by using a closed-set classifier. This enables to model the abnormal classes by atypical normal samples. Accordingly, the open-set recognition problem is reformulated into a traditional classification problem. In addition, a closed-set regularization is proposed to guarantee a high closed-set classification performance. Intensive experiments on five well-known image datasets showed the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperformed the baselines and achieved a distinct improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel generic one-class feature learning method based on intra-class splitting. In one-class classification, feature learning is challenging, because only samples of one class are available during training. Hence, state-of-the-art methods require reference multi-class datasets to pretrain feature extractors. In contrast, the proposed method realizes feature learning by splitting the given normal class into typical and atypical normal samples. By introducing closeness loss and dispersion loss, an intra-class joint training procedure between the two subsets after splitting enables the extraction of valuable features for one-class classification. Various experiments on three well-known image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperformed other baseline models in average.},

  abstract = {The performance of a light field reconstruction algorithm is typically affected by the disparity range of the input Sparsely-Sampled Light Field (SSLF). This paper finds that (i) one of the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation methods, i.e. adaptive Separable Convolution (SepConv), is especially effective for the light field reconstruction on a SSLF with a small disparity range (<; 10 pixels); (ii) one of the state-of-the-art light field reconstruction methods, i.e. Shearlet Transformation (ST), is especially effective in reconstructing a light field from a SSLF with a moderate disparity range (10-20 pixels) or a large disparity range (> 20 pixels). Therefore, to make full use of both methods to solve the challenging light field reconstruction problem on SSLFs with moderate and large disparity ranges, a novel method, referred to as Interpolation-Enhanced Shearlet Transform (IEST), is proposed by incorporating these two approaches in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, ST is employed to give a coarse estimation for the target light field, which is then refined by SepConv to improve the reconstruction quality of parallax views involving small disparity ranges. Experimental results show that IEST outperforms the other state-of-the-art light field reconstruction methods on nine challenging horizontalparallax evaluation SSLF datasets of different real-world scenes with moderate and large disparity ranges.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Hue modification is the adjustment of hue property on color images. Conducting hue modification on an image is trivial, and it can be abused to falsify opinions of viewers. Since shapes, edges or textural information remains unchanged after hue modification, this type of manipulation is relatively hard to be detected and localized. Based on the fact that small patches inherit the same Color Filter Array (CFA) configuration and demosaicing, any distortion made by local hue modification can be detected by patch matching within the same image. In this paper, we propose to localize hue modification by means of a Siamese neural network specifically designed for matching two inputs. By crafting the network outputs, we are able to form a heatmap which potentially highlights malicious regions. Our proposed method deals well not only with uncompressed images but also with the presence of JPEG compression, an operation usually hindering the exploitation of CFA and demosaicing artifacts. Experimental evidences corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We show in particular that spectral analysis is possible even if the levels amplitudes are unknown: they can be blindly estimated, jointly with the signal spectrum, up to harmless indeterminations of scale and offset. Simulations on synthetic signals demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing techniques.},

  abstract = {In Heterogeneous Networks, small cells are usually deployed without operator supervision. Their proper operation highly depends on their self-adaptation capability, especially in dense HetNets where various small cells coexist in the same macrocell. This capability requires the small-cell base stations to continuously sense the radio environment, so they can dynamically adapt their operational setting (e.g. transmission power, carrier/channel selection, etc.) to the environmental conditions. In this work we propose a new method for a small base station to monitor the activity of the rest of nodes in the macrocell. We consider a centralized sensing procedure based on the fusion of the energy levels measured by the users of the small cell at their locations. In particular, we present an efficient algorithm that enables the small base station to monitor the activity of the rest of nodes. In addition, the algorithm also provides the gain of the channels between the nodes and the users of the small cell.},

  abstract = {To evaluate their performance, existing dehazing approaches generally rely on distance measures between the generated image and its corresponding ground truth. Despite its ability to produce visually good images, using pixel-based or even perceptual metrics does not guarantee, in general, that the produced image is fit for being used as input for low-level computer vision tasks such as segmentation. To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy conditions. Results obtained using the proposed technique are appealing, with a favorable comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when considering the performance of segmentation algorithms on the hazy images.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates the Gesture-Keeper, a robust hand-gesture recognition system based on a wearable inertial measurements unit (IMU). The identification of the time windows where the gestures occur, without relying on an explicit user action or a special gesture marker, is a very challenging task. To address this problem, GestureKeeper identifies the start of a gesture by exploiting the underlying dynamics of the associated time series using a recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA is a powerful method for nonlinear time-series analysis, which enables the detection of critical transitions in the system's dynamical behavior. Most importantly, it does not make any assumption about the underlying distribution or model that governs the data. Having estimated the gesture window, a support vector machine is employed to recognize the specific gesture. Our proposed method is evaluated by means of a small-scale pilot study at FORTH and demonstrated that GestureKeeper can identify correctly the start of a gesture with a 87% mean balanced accuracy and classify correctly the specific hand-gesture with a mean accuracy of over 96%. To the best of our knowledge, GestureKeeper is the first automatic hand-gesture identification system based only on accelerometer. The performance analysis reveals the predictive power of the features and the system's robustness in the presence of additive noise. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of various parameters and a comparative analysis of different classifiers (SVM, random forests). Most importantly, the system can be extended to incorporate a large dictionary of gestures and operate without further calibration for a new user.},

Recent improvements in deep learning have increased the discriminative quality of i-vectors. However, deep learning architectures require a large amount of labeled background data which is difficult in practice. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative scheme in order to reduce the need of labeled data. We propose the use of autoencoder pre-training in a speaker verification task. First, we train an autoencoder in an unsupervised way, using a large amount of unlabeled background data. Then, we train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) initialized with the parameters of the pre-trained autoencoder. The DNN training is carried out in a supervised way using relatively small labeled background data. In the testing phase, we extract speaker embeddings as the output of an intermediate layer of the DNN. The training and evaluation were performed on VoxCeleb-2 and VoxCeleb1 databases, respectively. The experimental results have shown that by initializing DNN with the parameters of the pre-trained autoencoder, we have achieved a relative improvement of 21%, in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER), over the baseline i-vector/PLDA system.},

Here, we propose a computationally efficient technique based on embedding one single Gauss-Seidel iteration within every ADMM based detection iteration. The simulations are performed using an LTE-like TDD-OFDM frame structure and waveform, under perfect and non-perfect channel state information (CSI). Early results reveal that the proposed ADMM-GS algorithm can outperform the centralised GS based technique processing in a high SNR region and high load regime. In addition ADMM-GS' performance exhibits relatively less sensitivity to channel estimation error; a characteristic inherited from the centralised GS technique.},

  abstract = {The problem of passive detection, enumeration and localization of underwater objects is of great interest in several applications of sonar. Source localization requires prior knowledge of the number of sources. Therefore, detection is followed by estimation of the number of sources, and finally localization. Normally, each of the aforementioned objectives is treated as a different problem, and separate processing techniques are employed to solve them. In this paper, we propose two techniques, viz. the embedded subspace detector (ESD) and the Bartlett processor detector (BPD), for joint detection and enumeration of underwater acoustic sources using a vertical linear array of sensors. The BPD is also capable of simultaneously estimating the range and depth of each source. Simulation results indicate that the proposed detectors can achieve good detection and enumeration at low signal-to-noise ratio, and that their enumeration performance compares very favorably with those of established source enumeration techniques such as Akaike information criterion and minimum description length.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Auditory attention detection (AAD) is an essential building block for future generations of `neuro-steered' hearing prostheses. In a multi-speaker scenario, it uses neural recordings to detect to which speaker the listener is attending and assists as such the noise reduction algorithm within the hearing device. Recently, a multitude of these AAD algorithms has been developed, based on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. With the emergence of AAD algorithms, a standardized way of evaluating these AAD algorithms becomes paramount. However, this is not trivial due to an inherent trade-off between detection delay and accuracy. We propose a new performance metric to evaluate AAD algorithms that resolves this trade-off: the expected switch duration (ESD). The ESD is based on a Markov chain model of an adaptive gain control system in a hearing aid and quantifies the expected time needed to switch its operation from one speaker to another when the attention is switched. We validate the metric on simulated data and show on real EEG recordings that it is an interpretable metric that allows fair comparison between AAD algorithms, combining both the accuracy of the AAD algorithm and the time needed to make a decision.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method of estimation of short-time spectrum for analysis of speech signals in the closed phase regions of glottal activity. This method uses Teager Energy Operator (TEO) and a related Energy Separation Algorithm (ESA) iteratively, along with the design of digital resonator to estimate formants from a very short duration of the speech. The spectrum of cascade of these four resonators is referred to as our proposed ESA spectrum of speech. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in using very short duration of analysis speech frame that is synchronized with glottal closure instant (i.e., about 1-2 ms) to estimate the proposed spectrum in order to ensure that the vocal tract system characteristics do not change much within this interval and to alleviate erroneous estimation of formants due to nonlinear interaction of excitation source with the vocal tract system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm for formant estimation on speech data, we have used 1.5 ms speech signal corresponding to closed phase glottal cycles derived from a male speaker of CMU-ARCTIC database.},

A novel approach of hidden Markov model (HMM) based data augmentation is presented that increases the number of available image-specific input-output pairs to train the LSTM appropriately.

Experiments have been carried out using this proposed feature set, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and their score-level fusion. Classification was primarily performed using a discriminatively-trained 2nd order polynomial classifier on a subset of the MEEI database for a feature dimension of 12. The equal error rate (EER) on fusion was reduced by 3.2% than MFCC alone which was used as the baseline. The classification accuracy was analyzed for different dimensions of feature vector. Furthermore, results obtained for the 2nd order classifier were compared with the results obtained from the 3rd order polynomial classifier for different feature dimensions. In addition, the effectiveness of dynamic features, in particular, delta, delta-delta, and shifted delta cepstral features have been investigated for this particular problem. It has been observed that the score-level fusion (with equal weights) of proposed feature set and state-of-the-art MFCC gave better classification performance than MFCC alone for various evaluation factors considered in this paper.},

The joint optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer and non-linear programming problem, such that the data requests can be delivered by minimum delay, and the power consumption can meet practical requirements. For solving the problem to the global optimum, we provide a solution to decouple the scheduling and power optimization. Due to the problem's inherent hardness, the optimal solution requires exponential complexity and time in computations. To enable an efficient and competitive solution, we propose a learning-based approach to reduce data delivery time and solution's computational delay, where a deep neural network is trained to learn and decide how to optimize user scheduling. In numerical study, the developed optimal solution can be used for performance benchmarking and generating training data for the proposed learning approach.

Such events may exhibit significant variability, which makes their recognition a very challenging task. Furthermore, the fact that interactive systems require an immediate response to achieve low latency in real-time scenarios, poses major constraints to be overcome. This paper focuses on the design of a novel method for identifying the sound-producing objects, as well as the location of impact of each event, under a low-latency assumption. To this end, a sparse representation coding framework is adopted based on learned discriminative dictionaries from short training and testing data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a set of real impact sounds and compared against a nearest neighbour classifier. The experimental results demonstrate the high performance improvements of our proposed method, both in terms of classification accuracy and low latency.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Living in the age of the digital media explosion, the amount of data that is being stored increases dramatically. However, even if existing storage systems suggest efficiency in capacity, they are lacking in durability. Hard disks, flash, tape or even optical storage have limited lifespan in the range of 5 to 20 years. Interestingly, recent studies have proven that it was possible to use synthetic DNA for the storage of digital data, introducing a strong candidate to achieve data longevity. The DNA's biological properties allows the storage of a great amount of information into an extraordinary small volume while also promising efficient storage for centuries or even longer with no loss of information. However, encoding digital data onto DNA is not obvious, because when decoding, we have to face the problem of sequencing noise robustness. Furthermore, synthesizing DNA is an expensive process and thus, controlling the compression ratio by optimizing the rate-distortion trade-off is an important challenge we have to deal with. This work proposes a coding solution for the storage of digital images onto synthetic DNA. We developed a new encoding algorithm which generates a DNA code robust to biological errors coming from the synthesis and the sequencing processes. Furthermore, thanks to an optimized allocation process the solution is able to control the compression ratio and thus the length of the synthesized DNA strand. Results show an improvement in terms of coding potential compared to previous state-of-the-art works.},

Playlists are still mainly manually generated by expert curators, or users, process that in several cases is not a feasible with huge amount of music to deal with. There is the need of effective automatic playlist generation techniques. Traditional approaches to the problem are based on building a sequence of music pieces that satisfies some manually defined criteria. However, being the playlist generation a highly subjective procedure, to define an a-priori criterion can be an hard task in several cases. In this study we propose an automatic playlist generation approach which analyses hand-crafted playlists, understands their structure and evolution and generates new playlists accordingly. We adopt Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the sequence modelling. Moreover, since the representation model adopted to describe each song is determinant and is also connected to the human perception, we take advantages of Convolutions Neural Network (CNN) to learn meaningful audio descriptors.},

  abstract = {Calibration is instrumental to realize the full performance of a measurement system. In this contribution we consider the calibration of a uniformly linear array antenna where we assume each antenna element has an unknown complex gain. We present an algorithm which can be used to calibrate the array without full knowledge of the environment. Particularly, if the number of signal sources are known we show that we can determine the individual unknown antenna gains up to an ambiguity parametrized by a single complex scalar. If the ratio of the complex gains between two consecutive elements is also known, this ambiguity is resolved. The method is based on determining the antenna calibration parameters such that the Hankel matrix of the array snapshots has a given rank. A numerical example illustrates the performance of the method. The numerical results suggest that the method is consistent in SNR.},

In this work we train AMS-based features using a combination of a model-based optimization (MBO) approach and feature selection for full-band DRR and full-band T60 estimation. MBO replaces the computational complex data-based cost function by approximating a less complex surrogate model and thus reduces the time needed for training. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available ACE challenge corpus and achieve with only five features the best RMSE in the DRR estimation task using the single microphone configuration and upper mid-range performance for T60 estimation.

In the following study, we are interested in singing voice separation for mono signals and will investigate into comparing the U-Net and the Wave-U-Net that are structurally similar, but work on different input representations. First, we report a few results on variations of the U-Net model. Second, we will discuss the potential of state of the art speech and music transformation algorithms for augmentation of existing data sets and demonstrate that the effect of these augmentations depends on the signal representations used by the model. The results demonstrate a considerable improvement due to the augmentation for both models. But pitch transposition is the most effective augmentation strategy for the U-Net model, while transposition, time stretching, and formant shifting have a much more balanced effect on the Wave-U-Net model. Finally, we compare the two models on the same dataset.},

  abstract = {Many sleep studies suffer from the problem of insufficient data to fully utilize deep neural networks as different labs use different recordings set ups, leading to the need of training automated algorithms on rather small databases, whereas large annotated databases are around but cannot be directly included into these studies for data compensation due to channel mismatch. This work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome the channel mismatch problem and transfer knowledge from a large dataset to a small cohort to study automatic sleep staging with single-channel input. We employ the state-of-the-art SeqSleepNet and train the network in the source domain, i.e. the large dataset. Afterwards, the pretrained network is finetuned in the target domain, i.e. the small cohort, to complete knowledge transfer. We study two transfer learning scenarios with slight and heavy channel mismatch between the source and target domains. We also investigate whether, and if so, how finetuning entirely or partially the pretrained network would affect the performance of sleep staging on the target domain. Using the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and the Sleep-EDF Expanded database consisting of 20 subjects as the target domain in this study, our experimental results show significant performance improvement on sleep staging achieved with the proposed deep transfer learning approach. Furthermore, these results also reveal the essential of finetuning the feature-learning parts of the pretrained network to be able to bypass the channel mismatch problem.},

A novel method based on a block sparse representation is proposed to estimate the directions of sources. The data model is constructed under the framework of block sparse signal representation. Then, a convex problem is formulated to find the directions of the incident signals, and the problem can be solved using the L1-SVD algorithm. Unlike the existing eigenstructure-based methods and other sparsity-based methods which require appropriate initial values of the unknown sensor gain and phase errors for iterating between unknown sensor errors and angles of sources, the proposed block sparsity-based DOA estimation technique does not need any prior knowledge about the array errors. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

State-of-the-art solutions to encode light field images using the PVS format rely on video coding standards to exploit the inter-view redundancy between each sub-aperture image (SAI) that composes the light field. However, the PVS scanning order is not usually considered by the video codec. The proposed solution signals the PVS scanning order to the decoder, enabling implicit optimized reference picture selection for each specific scanning order. With the proposed method each reference picture is selected by minimizing the Euclidean distance to the current SAI being encoded. Experimental results show that, for the same PVS scanning order, the proposed optimized reference picture selection codec outperforms HEVC video coding standard for light field image coding, up to 50% in terms of bitrate savings.},

  abstract = {Vehicular and indoor communications continue to grow. This pertains to applications in aviation as well, which is also experiencing rapid growth. Since a pre-requisite to reliable communication link design is accurate knowledge of the wireless channel, research on channel models for these environments is an active area of study, and this is the topic of this paper. In this work, we report on measurement and model results for propagation path loss in two indoor airport environments, in two frequency bands. The first environment is a typical small terminal building, with characteristics similar to indoor offices, and the second is a more unusual aircraft maintenance hangar. The hangar is a crowded environment with multiple aircraft and metallic objects. Our results are for both the 30 GHz band (specifically 31 GHz), which is being investigated for future 5th generation cellular and other applications, and for the 5 GHz band, for a comparison. Our results show that the airport terminal building exhibits path loss characteristics very similar to those of an indoor office environment, at both frequencies, and this is largely as expected. In contrast, the maintenance hangar path loss is less than that of non-line of sight terminal building regions, somewhat unexpectedly. We attribute this to the highly reflective hangar environment, which serves to compensate for reduced diffraction and increased blockage losses at 31 GHz.},

The proposed method performs 2D non-decimated wavelet transform on the input image dividing the image into its subbands. It then splits each resulting subband into a number of bands evenly based on the coefficient values. Standard PCA is then applied on each resulting set of bands to extract the subbands eigenvectors, which are used as features for matching.

  abstract = {Convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) is a widely used technique in many applications on the signal/image processing and computer vision fields. While many algorithms have been proposed in order to improve the computational run-time performance during the training process, a thorough analysis regarding the direct relationship between the reconstruction performance and the dictionary features (hyper-parameters), such as the filter size and filter bank's cardinality, has not yet been presented.As arbitrarily configured dictionaries do not necessarily guarantee the best possible results during the test process, a correct selection of the hyper-parameters would be very favorable in the training and testing stages. In this context, this works aims to provide an empirical support for the choice of hyper-parameters when learning convolutional dictionaries. We perform a careful analysis of the effect of varying the dictionary's hyper-parameters through a denoising task. Furthermore, we employ a recently proposed local ℓ0,∞ norm as a sparsity measure in order to explore possible correlations between the sparsity induced by the learned filter bank and the reconstruction quality at test stage.},

Focusing on an MPEG-2 double compression scheme, we analyze how the variance of the prediction residue evolves during the second compression depending on the type of frame (either I or P) employed in the first encoding and exploring different compression strengths and deadzone widths for quantization. This analysis reveals that the width of the quantizer deadzones actually affects the performance of existing methods based on the Variation of Prediction Footprint (VPF) for double compression detection and Group Of Pictures (GOP) size estimation.

These vehicles are coupled in certain groups and drive simultaneously to enhance the road capacity and energy efficiency. The estimation of formation, i.e. the position of each individual vehicle w.r.t. the group, from the 5G signal is precise enough, so that the antennas deployed on multiple vehicles can be collectively considered as a distributed virtual antenna array. Non-cooperative entities, e.g. 5G incompatible vehicles, pedestrians or other road users, with radio transmissions according to a previous standard, can be precisely localized relative to the formation by distributed near-field array processing. By jointly locating the targets, the formation estimate of the 5G enabled vehicles is further improved.},

In the first step, the relative geometry of the sources and arrays is inferred by the proposed maximum likelihood estimator. It is derived under the assumption that the acquired unit-norm vectors pointing towards the unknown source positions follow a von Mises-Fisher distribution in a D-dimensional space. In the second step, the absolute positions and synchronization offsets between the arrays are estimated from the inferred relative geometry by using the Least Squares procedure. To improve the accuracy of the method, we propose as well the use of a reliability measure for the estimated Directions of Arrival based on the presented directional statistics model. The results of numerical experiments confirm the validity of the proposed approach.},

For large problem dimensions the lifting procedure is, however, inefficient as it drastically increases the number of optimization variables.

In this paper, we rely on the unfolding of an iterative algorithm for sparse approximation with side information, and design a deep learning architecture for multimodal image super-resolution that incorporates sparse priors and effectively utilizes information from another image modality. We develop two deep models performing reconstruction of a high-resolution image of a target image modality from its low-resolution variant with the aid of a high-resolution image from a second modality.

However, these palynology studies rely on highly qualified professionals to analyze pollen grains, which have become scarce and costly. Therefore, the automation of this task using computational methods is promising. Deep learning has proven to be the ultimate technique in computer vision tasks, but is very difficult to build a pollen data set with size enough to train such networks from scratch. This study investigated the use of transfer learning from pre-trained deep neural networks for pollen classification and compared their results with training from scratch and with promising predesigned features. Additionally, we introduced the biggest data set of pollen to the date. Experimental results achieved up to 96.24% of classification accuracy, suggesting that the fine-tuned deep learning architectures can be successfully applied to pollen classification.},

To address it, this paper presents a system that recognizes the 24 static fingerspelled alphabet signs of the American Sign Language. The system consists of two algorithmic stages, comprising an efficient preprocessing phase that generates candidate hand-region proposals, followed by their deep-learning based classification. Specifically, the first stage exploits own earlier work on hand detection and segmentation in videos that also contain the signer's face, allowing face detection to drive skin-tone based hand segmentation, with motion further utilized to localize hands, extending it with a peak detection module that yields proposal regions likely to contain the signs of interest. These regions are then classified by a variant of a convolutional neural network that extends traditional convolutions to quadratic operations on the inputs, being, to our knowledge, the first application of such architecture to this task. Both system stages are evaluated on three well-known fingerspelling corpora, significantly outperforming a number of alternative approaches under both multi-signer and signer-independent experimental frameworks.},

Maximising detection accuracy is vital as is minimising processing requirements given the limitations of an ASV. This leads to an examination of the tradeoff between accuracy and processing requirements. Three broad types of machine learning methods are explored - convolution neural network (CNNs), time-domain methods and feature-based methods. CNNs are found to give best performance in terms of both detection accuracy and processing requirements. These were also tolerant to downsampling down to 1kHz which gave a slight improvement in accuracy as well as a significant reduction in processing time. This we attribute to the bandwidth of right whale calls which is around 250Hz and so downsampling is able to capture the sounds fully as well as removing unwanted noisy spectral regions.},

Among many feasible sources, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) becomes one of the vibrant big data sources where a huge volume of data is generated from various sensor nodes in large-scale networks. Compared to traditional networks, WSN faces serious challenges especially in data management and conserving sensor energies. In this work, we propose a novel two phases big data processing mechanism, called ONIN: on-node and in-node (between nodes). In the first phase, we introduce the Newton's forward difference method to reduce the amount of data generated at each sensor node. Meanwhile, in the second phase we perform a clustering technique, i.e. PKmeans (Pattern-Kmeans) algorithm, and aim to reduce the redundancy among data generated by neighboring nodes. Through both simulations and experiments on real telosB motes, we evaluated the efficiency of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing data transmission and conserving sensor energies, compared to other existing techniques.},

  abstract = {The security in satellite communications is a key issue due to the large footprint of the beams. This is specially critical in IoT devices that transmit data directly to satellite. Take into account that IoT devices are characterized by transmitting packets of short length. Consequently, it means that it is not feasible to augment the security level of the IoT packets via complex cryptographic algorithms. Otherwise, their packet lengths may be increased in a non-negligible way which could augment their collision probabilities, latencies and energy consumptions. For this reason, this paper proposes to take advantage of the time-packing technique. By doing so, it is possible to use the overlapping degree among the pulse-shapes to boost the secrecy-capacity. In particular, the overlapping degree between the pulse-shapes introduces an artificial interference that degrades the eavesdropper's channel. In this regard, it is necessary to highlight that there is a residual co-channel interference in the satellite beams. So, it means that these two sources of impairments make difficult to estimate the legitimate user's transmission parameters by the eavesdropper.},

  abstract = {Intractable integrals appear in a plethora of problems in science and engineering. Very often, such integrals involve also a targeted distribution which is not even available in a closed form. In both cases, approximations of the integrals must be performed. Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a usual way of tackling the problem by approximating the integral with random samples. Quadrature methods are another alternative, where the integral is approximated with deterministic points and weights. However, the choice of these points and weights is only possible in a selected number of families of distributions. In this paper, we propose a deterministic method inspired in MC for approximating generic integrals. Our method is derived via an importance sampling (IS) interpretation, a MC methodology where the samples are simulated from the so-called proposal density, and weighted properly. We use Gauss-Hermite quadrature rules for Gaussian distributions, transforming them for approximating integrals with respect to generic distributions, even in the case where its normalizing constant is unknown. The novel method allows the use of several proposal distributions, allowing for the incorporation of recent advances in the multiple IS (MIS) literature. We discuss the convergence of the method, and we illustrate its performance with two numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Interest in stress recognition has notably increased over the past few years. In this work, we focus on recognizing stress from speech. We propose the use of modulation spectral features as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying stress. As benchmark, the OpenSMILE features used in the INTERSPEECH 2010 Paralinguistic Challenge is adopted and evaluated with a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep neural network (DNN) based backends. Experiments are performed with the well-known Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database. Performances are investigated considering 2-class, 4-class and 9-class classification problems. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark on a challenging 9-class classification task with accuracy as high as 70% representing gains of roughly 18% over the benchmark.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {With the rise of smart-watches and other wearables, off-the-person electrocardiography is gaining momentum as high-quality Lead 1 ECG signals can now be acquired from a persons hands or arms. Although several heart disease detection algorithms have been described in recent years, they are not designed considering Lead 1-only setups. This work bridges this gap with an architecture for a robust Lead 1 real-time heart disease detection system and an FPGA-based implementation. The proposed system is based on a signal processing pipeline composed of: ECG signal denoising; heartbeat detection and segmentation; extraction of dynamic morphological features; and heartbeat classification (standard and different abnormal heartbeats). Resorting to the only database from MITs Physiobank with Lead 1 annotated recordings, InCarTDb, the proposed pipeline resulted in a 4-class model with a classification accuracy of up to 96.5%. Moreover, when implemented in a Zynq-7 ZC702 Evaluation Board, the proposed architecture requires less than 30% of the FPGA resources and a total power consumption of 192 mW at a clock frequency of 35 MHz.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {During the last decade, there is an ever increasing interest about the decryption and analysis of the human visual system, which offers an intelligent mechanism for capturing and transforming the visual stimulus into a very dense and informative code of spikes. The compression capacity of the visual system is beyond the latest image and video compression standards, motivating the image processing community to investigate whether a neuro-inspired system, that performs according to the visual system, could outperform the state-of the-art image compression methods. Inspired by neuroscience models, this paper proposes for a first time a neuro-inspired compression method for RGB images. Specifically, each color channel is processed by a retina-inspired filter combined with a compression scheme based on spikes. We demonstrate that, even for a very small number of bits per pixel (bpp), our proposed compression system is capable of extracting faithful and exact knowledge from the input scene, compared against the JPEG that generates strong artifacts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm we use Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) Image Quality Assessments (IQA). We further validate the performance improvements by applying an edge detector on the decompressed images, illustrating that contour extraction is much more precise for the images compressed via our neuro-inspired algorithm.},

  abstract = {Automatic fall detection for the elderly is one of the most important health-care applications since it enables a rapid medical intervention preventing serious consequences of falls. Wrist-worn fall detectors represent one of the most convenient solutions. However, power consumption has a notable impact on the acceptability of such devices since it affects the size and weight of the required battery and the rate of replacing/recharging it. In this paper, an acceleration-based fall detection system is proposed for wrist-worn devices. It consists of two stages. The first one is a highly-sensitive low computational complexity algorithm to be embedded in the wearable device. When a potential fall is detected, raw data are transmitted to a remote server for accurate analysis in order to reduce the number of false alarms. The second stage algorithm is based on machine learning and applied to highly discriminant features. The latter are selected using powerful feature selection algorithms where the input is 12000 features extracted from each entry of a large activity dataset. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 100% when evaluated on a 2400-file dataset. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed system has been validated in real world conditions where it has been realized and tested using a smart watch and a server.},

We introduce a new clustering framework using patch-based nearest neighbor matching, while most existing methods are based on a pixel-wise K-means clustering. Therefore, we directly group pixels in the patch space enabling to capture texture information.

  abstract = {We propose a semi-supervised multichannel speech enhancement system based on a probabilistic model which assumes that both speech and noise follow the heavy-tailed multi-variate complex Cauchy distribution. As we advocate, this allows handling strong and adverse noisy conditions. Consequently, the model is parameterized by the source magnitude spectrograms and the source spatial scatter matrices. To deal with the non-additivity of scatter matrices, our first contribution is to perform the enhancement on a projected space. Then, our second contribution is to combine a latent variable model for speech, which is trained by following the variational autoencoder framework, with a low-rank model for the noise source. At test time, an iterative inference algorithm is applied, which produces estimated parameters to use for separation. The speech latent variables are estimated first from the noisy speech and then updated by a gradient descent method, while a majoriation-equalization strategy is used to update both the noise and the spatial parameters of both sources. Our experimental results show that the Cauchy model outperforms the state-of-art methods. The standard deviation scores also reveal that the proposed method is more robust against non-stationary noise.},

  abstract = {In order to efficiently perform inference on high-dimensional nonlinear non-Gaussian state-space models using particle filtering, it is critical that particles are generated from the optimal proposal distribution. However, finding a closed-form to the optimal proposal proves to be difficult in practice, as many application problems do not satisfy the requirement of conjugate state and observation equations. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by designing a novel method that introduces conjugate artificial noise into the system and optimally perturbs the particles in a way that balances a bias-variance tradeoff. Our method is validated through extensive numerical simulations applied to a gene regulatory network problem, and results show better performance than that of state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases where the state noise is heavy-tailed.},

A comparative study was conducted to identify which classifier architecture obtained the best discrimination performance for non-conforming components.

This is achieved by isolating spatiotemporal salient regions on consecutive GPR traces. These regions are represented by utilizing the coefficients of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition. Matched representations indicate meaningful tracked regions on the GPR traces that correspond to a fixed time window of data recording. Tracked regions are encoded in the form a vector that is treated as an observation within a particle filtering framework and is further processed to estimate the GPR sensor pose, given (i) a known subsurface map (ii) a simulated GPR model and (iii) priors in the GPR motion model.

Subsequently, we estimate the time-varying CCA radius via a non-linear least-squares method and a Kalman filter. The application of the JIPDA filter is enabled by a linearized state-space model describing the quasi-periodic movement of the FPs and the measurement extraction process.

  title = {Reproducibility of Deep CNN for Biomedical Image Processing Across Frameworks and Architectures},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {With the increasing spread of easy and effective frameworks, in recent years Deep Learning approaches are becoming more and more used in several application fields, including computer vision (such as natural and biomedical image processing), automatic speech recognition (ASR) and time-series analysis. If, on one hand, the availability of such frameworks allows developers to use the one they feel more comfortable with, on the other, it raises questions related to the reproducibility of the designed model across different hardware and software configurations, both at training and at inference times. The reproducibility assessment is important to determine if the resulting model produces good or bad outcomes just because of luckier or blunter environmental training conditions. This is a non-trivial problem for Deep Learning based applications, not only because their training and optimization phases strongly rely on stochastic procedures, but also because of the use of some heuristic considerations (mainly speculative procedures) at training time that, although they help in reducing the required computational effort, tend to introduce non-deterministic behavior, with a direct impact on the results and on the model's reproducibility. Usually, to face this problem, designers make use of probabilistic considerations about the distribution of data or focus their attention on very huge datasets. However, this kind of approach does not really fit some application field standards (such as medical imaging analysis with Computer-Aided Detection and Diagnosis systems - CAD) that require strong demonstrable proofs of effectiveness and repeatability of results across the population. It is our opinion that in those cases it is of crucial importance to clarify if and to what extent a Deep Learning based application is stable and repeatable as well as effective, across different environmental (hardware and software) configurations. Therefore, the aim of this work is to quantitatively analyze the reproducibility problem of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based approaches for the biomedical image processing, in order to highlight the impact that a given software framework and hardware configurations might have when facing the same problem by the same means. In particular, we analyzed the problem of breast tissue segmentation in DCE-MRI by using a modified version of a 2D U-Net CNN, a very effective deep architecture for semantic segmentation, using two Deep Learning frameworks (MATLAB and TensorFlow) across different hardware configurations.},

  abstract = {The high cost and power consumption of millimeter wave (mmWave) radio frequency (RF) hardware elements demands for advanced signal processing techniques to design MIMO transceivers. Hybrid analog-digital architectures for MIMO transceivers have become an attractive strategy to reduce the number of RF chains of the transceivers. In the uplink of a multiuser mmWave MIMO system, this hardware reduction is limited by the number of users to be handled, which can be rather large. In this work, we propose to use distributed quantizer linear coding (DQLC) in order to superimpose correlated sources in a cluster-based uplink multiuser mmWave MIMO system and reduce the number of RF chains at the receiver. The scheduling policy to cluster the transmitters is also analyzed by considering the correlation of the sources and channel state information (CSI). Numerical results show the advantage of employing the proposed scheme to reduce hardware complexity.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are very popular nowadays for image processing. CNNs allow one to learn optimal filters in a (mostly) supervised machine learning context. However this typically requires abundant labelled training data to estimate the filter parameters. Alternative strategies have been deployed for reducing the number of parameters and / or filters to be learned and thus decrease overfitting. In the context of reverting to preset filters, we propose here a computationally efficient harmonic block that uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) filters in CNNs. In this work we examine the performance of harmonic networks in limited training data scenario. We validate experimentally that its performance compares well against scattering networks that use wavelets as preset filters.},

  abstract = {The capacity region of the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel is an open problem, and various achievable rate regions have been discussed in the literature. In this paper, we assume that the transmit signals are Gaussian and that the receivers treat interference as noise (TIN), i.e., we focus on the TIN rate region with Gaussian inputs. Our aim is to compute the rate region boundary for the case of proper Gaussian signaling with time-sharing, i.e., the data rates and required transmit powers may be averaged over several transmit strategies. To this end, we apply methods from convex optimization (in particular Lagrange duality and the cutting plane algorithm), and propose the novel mixed monotonic programming (MMP) framework to treat the arising nonconvex subproblems. The obtained TIN rate region with proper Gaussian signals and time-sharing is significantly larger than previously computed TIN rate regions with proper Gaussian signals, and can even outperform TIN strategies with improper signaling.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new closed-form semiblind receiver for a two-way decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system. The proposed receiver jointly estimates the symbol and channel matrices involved in the two-way relaying system by exploiting tensor structures of the received signals at the relay and the destination, without using training sequences. The proposed receiver exploits a cross-coding approach using a third-order tensor space-time code (TSTC) at the relay, and it does not require a channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink phases, which can be of interest in frequency division duplex relaying systems. The advantages of this DF receiver compared with the amplify-and-forward (AF) receivers of [14] are three-fold: 1) use of the DF protocol which makes it possible to attenuate the propagation errors compared to the AF protocol, at the cost of an additional decoding at the relay, 2) a cross-coding approach which allows the suppression of interference between sources and therefore greatly simplifies the receivers, and 3) the closed-form aspect of the receivers based on a least squares (LSs) Kronecker product factorization algorithm. Parameter identifiability and computational complexity are analysed, and simulation results are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed semiblind receiver and coding scheme when compared with the AF receivers of [11].},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Volume alignment is a computationally intensive task. In Subtomogram Averaging (StA) from electron cryotomograms (CryoET), thousands of subtomograms are aligned to a reference, which may take hours until days of computational time. CryoET datasets contain a limited number of noisy projections, with very low signal-to-until ratio (SNR). The noisy subtomograms are aligned to a reference using cross-correlation, an operation that can be optimized when working with limited angle tomograms (LAT), as they are sparse in Fourier space. We propose a projected cross-correlation (pCC) algorithm, a faster approach to computing the cross-correlation between a limited angle (sub)-tomogram and a given reference, and we use pCC to design a new procedure for volume alignment. pCC employs the projections to calculate the cross-correlation with lower computational complexity, as it works with a set 2D projections instead of volumes. With this, we propose the Substacks Averaging (SsA) method as an alternative to the conventional Subtomogram Averaging (StA). Our results on test data shows that SsA is considerably faster than the reference StA implementation: for 41 projections (k= 41) and N=200, the SsA is 35 times faster, and for N=320, is 150 times faster. Furthermore, SsA results in higher precision of alignment of subtomograms at different noise levels.},

This requires to estimate accurately the rank of the considered tensor to be decomposed. Therefore, a two-step approach, named R-CPD-SISSY, is proposed including a rank estimation process and a source localization procedure. The first step consists in using a modified version of a recent method, which estimates both the rank and the loading matrices of a tensor following the canonical polyadic decomposition model. The second step uses a recent physics-driven tensor-based BSI method, named STS-SISSY, in order to localize the brain regions of interest. This second step uses the estimated rank during the first step. The performance of the R-CPD-SISSY algorithm is studied using realistic synthetic interictal epileptic recordings.},

  abstract = {Random projections belong to the major techniques to process big data and have been successfully applied to Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). However, they cannot be applied in the case of missing entries in the matrix to factorize, which occurs in many actual problems with large data matrices. In this paper, we thus aim to solve this issue and we propose a novel framework to apply random projections in weighted NMF, where the weight models the confidence in the data (or the absence of confidence in the case of missing data). We experimentally show the proposed framework to significantly speed-up state-of-the-art NMF methods under some mild conditions. In particular, the proposed strategy is particularly efficient when combined with Nesterov gradient or alternating least squares.},

  abstract = {Light field (LF) images provide rich visual information enabling amazing applications, from post-capture image processing to immersive applications. However, this rich information requires significant storage and bandwidth capabilities thus urgently raises the question of their compression. Many studies have investigated the compression of LF images using both spatial and angular redundancies existing in the LF images. Recently, interesting LF compression approaches based on view synthesis technique have been proposed. In these approaches, only sparse samples of LF views are encoded and transmitted, while the other views are synthesized at decoder side. Different techniques have been proposed to synthesize the dropped views. In this paper, we describe subjective quality evaluation of two recent compression methods based on view synthesis and comparing them to two pseudo-video sequence based coding approaches. Results show that view synthesis based approaches provide higher visual quality than the naive LF coding approaches. In addition, the database as well as subjective scores are publicly available to help designing new objective metrics or can be used as a benchmark for future development of LF coding methods.},

The considered wireless channel model accounts for both path loss and shadowing. We propose a method to optimise the trajectory of the MR so as to minimise the overall energy consumption of the DTSN, while controlling the latency of the end-to-end transmission and maintaining the number of bits in the SNs' buffers bounded.

In addition, we derive a low-complexity coordinated quality-of-service (QoS) aware resource allocation scheme that maximizes the sum-SE of coordinated beamforming (CBF) under given transmission power per base station, inter-system interference power, and per-user QoS constraints as well as simple alternatives for both CBF and JT. We consider a use case where a cellular network coexists with a fixed satellite service earth station in the 3.7-4.2 GHz C-band. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance gains of the proposed coordinated caching and resource allocation strategies and shed light on the impact of various parameters on their efficiency.},

The wireless communication channel is assumed to experience time-varying small-scale fading with time-varying coherence time. To achieve high reliability and low latency of the communication link, compensation for the small-scale fading is required. Since the MR has to stay on the predefined trajectory, we propose to compensate for the fading by continuously adjusting the position of the antenna on a revolving platform on-board the MR. This is done by a closed-loop antenna controller which optimises the position of the antenna at all times without modifying the trajectory to be followed by the MR. Results show that this technique can effectively compensate for the small-scale fading without introducing delays in data reception.},

  abstract = {In this study, a novel hybrid tensor factorisation and deep learning approach has been proposed and implemented for sleep pose identification and classification of twelve different sleep postures. We have applied tensor factorisation to infrared (IR) images of 10 subjects to extract group-level data patterns, undertake dimensionality reduction and reduce occlusion for IR images. Pre-trained VGG-19 neural network has been used to predict the sleep poses under the blanket. Finally, we compared our results with those without the factorisation stage and with CNN network. Our new pose detection method outperformed the methods solely based on VGG-19 and 4-layer CNN network. The average accuracy for 10 volunteers increased from 78.1% and 75.4% to 86.0%.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Tensor decomposition models have proven to be effective analysis tools in various applications, including signal processing, machine learning, and communications, to name a few. Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a very popular model, which decomposes a higher order tensor signal into a sum of rank 1 terms. However, when the tensor size gets big, computing the CPD becomes a lot more challenging. Previous works proposed using random (generalized) tensor sampling or compression to alleviate this challenge. In this work, we propose using a regular tensor sampling framework instead. We show that by appropriately selecting the sampling mechanism, we can simultaneously control memory and computational complexity, while guaranteeing identifiability at the same time. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real data showcase the effectiveness of our approach.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In radar networks, radars may share and broadcast their respective scheduling data. In this respect, communication signals emitted from a radar platform can convey radar signal and beam characteristics. In RF restricted operation environments and towards achieving a unified aperture and bandwidth, it would be desirable to embed such information in radar pulses without having to establish any communications link. In this paper, we consider dual system functionality in radar networks in which one system function enables the other. The focus is on scheduling data that can be reasonably encoded by radar pulses within one radar coherent processing interval (CPI). In order to limit changes in the radar waveform to a minimum, we use up- and down-chirps for information embedding. We consider two different signal embedding strategies in which each radar pulse represents one bit. Information deciphering at the downlink radar receivers is delineated, along with the corresponding probability of bit error assuming a Gaussian channel. The overall channel coding paradigm using radar chirps as parity bits is discussed.},

  abstract = {Visually plausible image forgeries are easy to create even without particular knowledge or skills. However, most forgeries unknowingly alter the underlying statistics of an image. In particular, demosaicing artefacts created by the camera are usually destroyed or modified when the image is tampered. Most of the literature focus on detecting where these traces are destroyed, and generally do it in a way that still requires a visual interpretation. We introduce an a contrariomethod which detects global demosaicing parameters, and then checks for regions of the image which are inconsistent with these parameters. Detections are guaranteed in the form of a number of false alarms (NFA), which enables the user to control the false positive rate. Such a guarantee is a useful complement to existing methods, and enables inclusion into fully automatic image authentication processes.

  abstract = {Fast and accurate fault diagnosis is important to ensure the reliability and the operation safety of rotating machinery, which is often based on vibration analysis. In this paper, a novel approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is proposed, in order not only to leverage upon the advantages of deep discriminative features (learnt by the CNN) but also to exploit the generalization performance of SVM classifiers. Firstly, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed to obtain the pre-processed representations of raw vibration signals. Then a novel CNN with a square-pooling architecture is built to extract high-level features, without requiring extra training and fine-tuning and thus demanding reduced computation cost. Finally, a SVM is used as classifier to conduct the fault classification. Experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from a gearbox. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to other algorithms in terms of computational cost and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Cued Speech (CS) is an augmented lip reading with the help of hand coding. Due to lips and hand movements are asynchronous and a direct fusion of these asynchronous features may reduce the efficiency of the recognition, the fusion of them in automatic CS recognition is a challenging problem. In our previous work, we built a hand preceding model for hand positions (vowels) by investigating the temporal organization of hand movements in French CS. In this work, we investigate a suitable value of the hand preceding time for consonants by analyzing the temporal movements of hand shapes in French CS. Then, based on these two results, we propose an efficient resynchronization procedure for the fusion of multi-stream features in CS. This procedure is applied to the continuous CS phoneme recognition based on the multi-stream CNN-HMMs architecture. The result shows that using this procedure brings an improvement of about 4.6% in the phoneme recognition correctness, compared with the state-of-the-art, which does not take into account the asynchrony of multi-modalities.},

To this end, we propose the use of a residual convolutional neural network aiming at exploiting the ability of such architectures to take into account large contextual segments of input data. Moreover, in order for variable input lengths to be supported by the proposed setting, a self-attention mechanism is employed on top of the final convolutional layer. This results in a learnable temporal feature pooling scheme that allows for embedding varying duration utterances into a fixed dimension space. Evaluation is performed on data containing ten oriental languages under different test conditions, namely: short-duration recordings, confusing languages trials, as well as a set of trials in which non-target unseen languages are included. End-to-end evaluation of the proposed framework is thus shown to significantly outperform well-known benchmark methods under considered evaluation conditions.},

We use state-of-the-art semantic segmentation to extract the contents of images and cluster different people according to what they perceive as safe. Then, we study semantic classes and analyze clusters of users for semantic elements appearing in images classified as safer (or more dangerous). The results show that clusters share a lot of similarities. Our analysis evidences that, for users with more pairwise comparisons, there is only one group, while spurious groupings appear when users contribute less. This result emphasizes that a pairwise image comparison dataset potentiates agreement of users in perceptual tasks, for moderate comparison data size.},

We create a compressive learning framework for ICA and show for the first time that the memory complexity scales only quadratically with respect to the number of independent sources n, resulting in a vast improvement over other ICA methods. This is made possible by demonstrating a low dimensional model set, that exists in the cumulant based ICA problem, can be stably embedded into a compressed space from a larger dimensional cumulant tensor space. We show that identifying independent source signals can be achieved with high probability when the compression size m is of the optimal order of the intrinsic dimension of the ICA parameters and propose a iterative projection gradient algorithm to achieve this.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating a sparse signal over a network. The main interest is to save communication resource for information exchange over the network and hence reduce processing time. With this aim, we develop a distributed learning algorithm where each node of the network uses a locally optimized convex optimization based algorithm. The nodes iteratively exchange their signal estimates over the network to refine the local estimates. The convex cost is constructed to promote sparsity as well as to include influence of estimates from the neighboring nodes. We provide a restricted isometry property (RIP)-based theoretical guarantee on the estimation quality of the proposed algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the algorithm provides competitive performance vis-a-vis a globally optimum distributed LASSO algorithm, both in convergence speed and estimation error.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Bispectrum representations previously achieved a successful classification of insulation fault signals in High-Voltage (HV) power plant. The magnitude information of the Bispectrum was implemented as a feature for a Deep Neural Network. This preliminary research brought interest in evaluating the performance of Bispectrum as complex input features that are implemented into a Deep Complex Valued Convolutional Neural Network (CV-CNN). This paper presents the application of this novel method to condition monitoring of High Voltage (HV) power plant equipment. Discharge signals related to HV insulation faults are measured in a real-world power plant using the Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) method and processed using third order Higher-Order Statistics (HOS) to obtain a Bispectrum representation. By mapping the time-domain signal to Bispectrum representations the problem can be approached as a complex-valued classification task. This allows for the novel combination of complex Bispectrum and CV-CNN applied to the classification of HV discharge signals. The network is trained on signals from 9 classes and achieves high classification accuracy in each category, improving upon the performance of a Real Valued CNN (RV-CNN).},

The proposed method chooses a transmission strategy that results in the lowest expected future transmission cost among a given set of strategies. In a practical IoT setting, statistical information of the measurements might be limited. Hence, without assuming any distribution for the measurements, the proposed method estimates the transmission cost for each strategy through bootstrap data where associated model residuals are resampled using the maximum entropy bootstrap algorithm, which preserves several stochastic properties of the empirical distribution. Numerical results with simulated and real world data shows that the proposed method results in significant reduction in the transmitted data.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) information of a signal is important for communications, localization and navigation systems. Time-delay based methods are popular DOA algorithms that can estimate DOA with a minimal number of receivers. Time delay can be measured with subsample accuracy using phase-difference based methods. Phase-wrapping represents a major challenge for time delay estimation that occurs when inter-sensor spacing is large. Several methods exist for phase-unwrapping; the most successful methods are those search methods, which are time-consuming and do not lend themselves to theoretical analysis. In this paper, we present a phase-difference projection (PDP) method for DOA estimation which is capable of delivering more accurate results with reduced computational complexity. The proposed method has been tested and compared with several benchmark algorithms in both simulations and experiments. The results show that, at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of -18 dB, using the proposed PDP algorithm, the percentage of the DOA estimates with errors smaller than <; 5° is 54%, and it reaches 100% at SNR = -7dB. This performance is not matched by the benchmark methods. For the utility test, we implemented this algorithm to realize an ultrasound-based air-mouse and it achieves satisfactory user experiences when using Google Maps, or playing some interactive games.},

Early diagnosis of dementia is imperative to provide timely treatment, either medication or therapy to alleviate the effects and sometimes slow the progression of dementia. In this work, we use speech processing and machine learning techniques to automatically classify speech into (a) healthy (HC) (b) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or (c) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Only acoustic non-linguistic parameters are used for this purpose, making this a language independent approach. We evaluate our work using dementia and healthy speech from Pitt corpus of DementiaBank database. The performance of a three class Random Forest classifier is compared with our system comprising multiple two-class Random Forest classifiers cascaded to form a three class classifier, wherein a combination of approximate posterior probabilities is used to obtain a final class probability estimate. additional, patient speech is classified at segment level as well as at overall conversation level. Post processing on the patient speech classification at segment level provides a classification accuracy of 82% which is a significant absolute improvement of 8% over a simple three-class classifier performance.},

In this paper, we explore the viability of using coordinated multi-point connectivity, which facilitates multi-user precoding across spatially distributed transmitters, to ensure reliable connectivity even if one or more dominant links are under blockage. We provide successive convex approximation based algorithms for weighted sum-rate maximization and minimum user-rate maximization problems while considering the effects of random link blockage. For the downlink precoder design, a conservative estimate of the available rate per user is computed over all subset combinations of potentially blocked links. The trade-off between achievable sum-rate and reliable connectivity is illustrated via numerical examples. In the presence of random link blockage, the outage performance and effective throughput of the proposed transmit precoder design significantly outperforms several baseline scenarios, and results in more stable connectivity for highly reliable communication.},

In general, these systems have to meet requirements such as affordability, reliability, and mobility. In general, surface electrodes are used to obtain signals caused by the contraction of underlying muscles of the forearm. These data are then used to decode hand gestures. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of replacing the electrodes by magnetometers that are cheap and can be easily implemented in mobile devices. We propose an inhomogeneously stacked recurrent neural network for classifying hand gestures given magnetometer data. The experiments reveal that the comparably small network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand gesture recognition systems relying on multi-modal data. Furthermore, the proposed network requires significantly shorter windows and enables a quickly responding classification system. Also, the experiments show that the performance of the proposed system does not vary much between subjects and works outstandingly for amputees.},

  abstract = {Multi-microphone signal processing is becoming increasingly popular in applications such as distant speech recognition or communication in adverse environments. To deploy source localization or signal enhancement algorithms like beamforming the locations of the microphones must be known. One well-studied approach to retrieve the relative positions of the microphones is based on time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements. However, current approaches are restricted to scenarios with a large number of sources or specific coherence assumptions. In this paper a non-iterative approach based on orthogonal geometric projection (OGP), which is able to perform a blind self-localization of the array in 2D with only two sources at arbitrary positions, is presented and extended to estimate a 3D array shape with only three sources. Furthermore, an efficient method for outlier correction in the pairwise distance (PD) estimates is proposed, that significantly reduces the position error.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In the last decade, Compressive Sensing (CS) has emerged as the most promising, model-driven approach to accelerate MRI scans. CS relies on the key sparsity assumption and proposes random sampling for data acquisition. The practical CS approaches in MRI employ variable-density (VD) sampling, where samples are drawn at random based on a parametric probability model which focuses on the center of the Fourier domain. In stark contrast to this model-driven sampling approaches, we propose a data-driven framework for optimizing sampling in parallel (multi-coil) MRI. Our approach does not assume any structure in the data, and instead optimizes a performance metric (e.g. PSNR) for any given reconstruction algorithm, based on our earlier learning-based sampling framework previously applied to 2D MRI which we also extend to 3D MRI setting in this work by employing lazy evaluations in the greedy algorithm. We show boosted performance for the parallel MRI based on this sampling approach and highlight the inefficiency of variable density approaches. This suggests that data-driven sampling methods could be the key to unlocking the full power of CS applied to MRI.},

The information specific users have conventional receiver architectures to process data, energy harvesting users collect energy using the non-linear energy harvesting module and each of the joint information decoding and energy harvesting capable user is assumed to employ the separated architecture with disparate non-linear energy harvesting and conventional information decoding units. In this context, we formulate and analyze the problem of total transmit power minimization for optimal precoder design subjected to minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio and harvested energy demands at the respective users under three different scenarios. This problem is solved via semi-definite relaxation and the advantages of employing separate information and energy precoders are shown over joint and per-user information and energy precoder designs.

Traditional approaches for estimating 360° image saliency rely on the exploitation of low and high-level image features, along with auxiliary data, such as head movement or eye-gazes. However, the image content plays an important role in saliency estimation. Based on this evidence, in the proposed method low-level features are combined with the detection of human faces. In this way it is possible to refine the saliency estimation based on the low-level features by assigning a larger weight to the regions containing faces. Experimental results on 360° image dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of recovering spherical harmonics coefficients from phaseless measurements and evaluate the empirical performance of several well-known algorithms. Apart from trivial ambiguities that arise naturally from the properties of spherical harmonics, we will show that when a specific class of equiangular sampling patterns is chosen to construct the measurement matrix, another ambiguity appears as well. Nevertheless, we will numerically show that recovery can be achieved by carefully choosing the appropriate sampling patterns. Furthermore, an application of this work in phaseless spherical near-field antenna measurements will be addressed.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Sequential data such as video are characterized by spatio-temporal correlations. As of yet, few deep learning algorithms exploit them to decrease the often massive cost during inference. This work leverages correlations in video data to linearize part of a deep neural network and thus reduce its size and computational cost. Drawing upon the simplicity of the typically used rectifier activation function, we replace the ReLU function by dynamically updating masks. The resulting layer stack is a simple chain of matrix multiplications and bias additions, that can be contracted into a single weight matrix and bias vector. Inference then reduces to an affine transformation of the input sequence with these contracted parameters. We show that the method is akin to approximating the neural network with a first-order Taylor expansion around a dynamically updating reference point. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a denoising convolutional autoencoder.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {Variational Bayesian (VB) estimation allows for approximate Bayesian inference. It determines the closest approximation in factored form of the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the posterior distribution even if this last one is difficult to determine. In spite of this well motivated derivation, the performance of VB techniques is not very clear, especially compared to more classical performance bounds. In this paper we explore recently introduced mismatched Cramer-Rao bounds (mCRB) for Bayesian estimation in the context of VB estimation. We focus on the case of bilinear signal models. One particular application of these models arises in the context of internal relative reciprocity calibration of Massive antenna arrays, in which the received signals are linear in terms of an intra array channel and the relative calibration factors. We have recently shown that a VB approach allows for particularly improved estimation performance that goes beyond the classical CRB, which is now confirmed by the mCRB.},

The experimental results demonstrate that AVHELM can yield satisfactory enhancement performance with a limited amount of training data and outperforms AHELM in terms of three standardized objective measures under matched and mismatched testing conditions, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating visual information into the HELM-based SE system.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {low-rank approximation problem has recently attracted wide concern due to its excellent performance in realworld applications such as image restoration, traffic monitoring, and face recognition. Compared with the classic nuclear norm, the Schatten-p norm is stated to be a closer approximation to restrain the singular values for practical applications in the real world. However, Schatten-p norm minimization is a challenging non-convex, non-smooth, and non-Lipschitz problem. In this paper, inspired by the reweighted l1 norm for compressive sensing, the generalized iterative reweighted nuclear norm (GIRNN) algorithm is proposed to approximate Schatten-p norm minimization. By involving the proposed algorithms, the problem becomes more tractable and the closed solutions are derived from the iteratively reweighted subproblems. Numerical experiments for the practical matrix completion (MC) problem and robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem are illustrated to validate the superior performance of both algorithms over some common state-of-the-art methods.},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {An off-the-shelf drone for indoor operation would come with a variety of different sensors that are used concurrently to avoid collision with, e.g., walls, but these sensors are typically uni-directional and offers limited spatial awareness. In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for distance estimation using sound and its reflections. More specifically, the technique is estimating Time-of-Arrivals (TOAs) of the reflected sound that could infer knowledge about room geometry and help in the design of sound-based collision avoidance. Our proposed solution is thus based on probing a known sound into an environment and then estimating the TOAs of reflected sounds recorded by a single microphone. The simulated results show that our approach to estimating TOAs for reflector position estimation works up to a distance of at least 2 meters even with significant additive noise, e.g., drone ego noise.},
