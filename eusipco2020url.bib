  year = {2020},
  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method called Hodge and Podge for sound event detection. We demonstrate Hodge and Podge on the dataset of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2019 Challenge Task 4. This task aims to predict the presence or absence and the onset and offset times of sound events in home environments. Sound event detection is challenging due to the lack of large scale real strongly labeled data. Recently deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be effective in modeling with weakly labeled and unlabeled data. This work explores how to extend deep SSL to result in a new, state-of-the-art sound event detection method called Hodge and Podge. With convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) as the backbone network, first, a multi-scale squeeze-excitation mechanism is introduced and added to generate a pyramid squeeze-excitation CRNN. The pyramid squeeze-excitation layer can pay attention to the issue that different sound events have different durations, and to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise spectrogram responses. Further, in order to remedy the lack of real strongly labeled data problem, we propose multi-hot MixMatch and composition consistency training with temporal-frequency augmentation. Our experiments with the public DCASE2019 challenge task 4 validation data resulted in an event-based F-score of 43.4%, and is about absolutely 1.6% better than state-of-the-art methods in the challenge. While the F-score of the official baseline is 25.8%.},

  abstract = {Commercially available light-weight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a challenge for public safety, e.g. espionage, transporting dangerous goods or devices. Therefore, countermeasures are necessary. Usually, detection of UAVs is a first step. Along many other modalities, acoustic detection seems promising. Recent publications show interesting results by using machine and deep learning methods. The acoustic detection of UAVs appears to be particularly difficult in adverse situations, such as in heavy wind noise or in the presence of construction noise. In this contribution, the typical feature set is extended to increase separation of background noise and the UAV signature noise. The decision algorithm utilized is support vector machine (SVM) classification. The classification is based on an extended training dataset labeled to support binary classification. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison to previously published algorithms, on the basis of a dataset recorded from different acoustic environments, including unknown UAV types. The results show an improvement over existing methods, especially in terms of false-positive detection rate. For a first step into real-time embedded systems a recursive feature elimination method is applied to reduce the model dimensionality. The results indicate only a slight decreases in detection performance.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {11-15},
  abstract = {The performance of machine learning algorithms is known to be negatively affected by possible mismatches between training (source) and test (target) data distributions. In fact, this problem emerges whenever an acoustic scene classification system which has been trained on data recorded by a given device is applied to samples acquired under different acoustic conditions or captured by mismatched recording devices. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method that consists of aligning the first- and second-order sample statistics of each frequency band of target-domain acoustic scenes to the ones of the source-domain training dataset. This approach is devised to adapt audio samples from unseen devices before they are fed to a pre-trained classifier, thus avoiding any further learning phase. Using the DCASE 2018 Task 1-B development dataset, we show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods found in the literature in terms of both source- and target-domain classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the surrounding environment plays a critical role in autonomous robotic systems, such as self-driving cars. Extensive research has been carried out concerning visual perception. Yet, to obtain a more complete perception of the environment, autonomous systems of the future should also take acoustic information into account. Recent sound event localization and detection (SELD) frameworks utilize convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). However, considering the recurrent nature of CRNNs, it becomes challenging to implement them efficiently on embedded hardware. Not only are their computations strenuous to parallelize, but they also require high memory bandwidth and large memory buffers. In this work, we develop a more robust and hardware-friendly novel architecture based on a temporal convolutional network (TCN). The proposed framework (SELD-TCN) outperforms the state-of-the-art SELDnet performance on four different datasets. Moreover, SELD-TCN achieves 4x faster training time per epoch and 40x faster inference time on an ordinary graphics processing unit (GPU).},

RPCA provides a mechanism to decompose a data matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. In the context of data representing acoustic soundscapes, the low-rank matrix represents the slow-changing background sound events, and the sparse matrix represents the occasional foreground sound events. The data representations are obtained as feature embeddings from pretrained deep convolutional networks. The paper investigates the effectiveness of classifying acoustic soundscapes by using the foreground or background information alone. Further, by using the subspace projection technique of nuisance attribute projection (NAP), the undesired components from the foreground or background are removed. Our results indicate that RPCA and subspace projections in-deed provide benefits in improving discrimination for classifying acoustic soundscapes.},

We evaluate the original resizing algorithm and introduce a novel one, comparing the performances against a baseline system. Two of the most relevant audio datasets are used for assessing the performances of the proposed approach. Experimental results suggest that progressive resizing methods improves the performances of audio events classification models.

For domain adaptation, the proposed method utilizes MCD to align class distributions that conventional DA for ASC methods have ignored. The multi-device robust ASC model is obtained by KD, combining the multiple device-specific ASC models by MCD that may have a lower performance for non-target devices. Our experiments show that the proposed MCD-based device-specific model improved ASC accuracy by at most 12.22% for target samples, and the proposed KD-based device-general model improved ASC accuracy by 2.13% on average for all devices.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a sound event localization and detection (SELD) method using a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with gated linear units (GLUs). The proposed method introduces to employ GLUs with convolutional neural network (CNN) layers of the CRNN to extract adequate spectral features from amplitude and phase spectra. When the CNNs extract features of high-dimensional dependencies of frequency bins, the GLUs weight the extracted features based on the importance of the bins, like attention mechanism. Extracted features from bins where sounds are absent, which is not informative and degrade the SELD performance, are weighted to 0 and ignored by GLUs. Only the features extracted from informative bins are used for the CNN output for better SELD performance. Obtained CNN outputs are fed to consecutive bi-directional gated recurrent units (GRUs), which capture temporal information. Finally, the GRU output are shared by two task-specific layers, which are sound event detection (SED) layers and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation layers, to obtain SELD results. Evaluation results using the TAU Spatial Sound Events 2019 - Ambisonic dataset show the effectiveness of GLUs in the proposed method, and it improves SELD performance up to 0.10 in F1-score, 0.15 in error rate, 16.4° in DoA estimation error comparing to a CRNN baseline method.},

For that purpose, we address the speaker counting problem with a multichannel convolutional recurrent neural network which produces an estimation at a short-term frame resolution. We trained the network to predict up to 5 concurrent speakers in a multichannel mixture, with simulated data including many different conditions in terms of source and microphone positions, reverberation, and noise.

  abstract = {Protecting the privacy of conversations containing confidential and sensitive information in semi-open rooms, such as in banks and hospitals, is essential but challenging because their acoustical characteristics, such as room impulse response (RIR) and background noise, are unknown and prone to change. This study proposes a scheme for protecting the privacy of conversations on the basis of feedback control of an estimated speech transmission index (STI). The STI is an objective index related to listening difficulty and is a function of RIR. Without measuring the RIR of the environment where a supposedly private conversation occurs, an STI-estimation method and one RIR model are utilized. The scheme modifies speech signals in such a way that, for an unintended listener, the signals are as unintelligible as they would be in a room with a low STI. To control the late reverberant parameter of the RIR model, a proportional-integral-derivative controller is used whose controller gains are tuned by using a differential evolution optimizer. Simulations and subjective tests were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The average error between the actual and target estimated STIs is 0.01. Furthermore, the subjective tests showed that the proposed method can effectively protect privacy under different conditions and is preferable to an open-loop control method.},

Publications in this field have shown that the surface condition of metal balls and different types of bulk materials (screws, nuts, etc.) sliding down a tube can be classified with a high accuracy using audio signals and deep neural networks. However, these systems suffer from domain shift, or dataset bias, due to minor changes in the recording setup which may easily happen in real-world production lines. This paper aims at finding methods to increase robustness of existing detection systems to domain shift, ideally without the need to record new data or retrain the models. Through five experiments, we implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for two publicly available ISA datasets and evaluate transfer learning, data normalization and data augmentation as approaches to deal with domain shift. Our results show that while supervised methods with additional labeled data are the best approach, an unsupervised method that implements data augmentation with adaptive normalization is able to improve the performance by a large margin without the need of retraining neural networks.},

Identification of type/position of inter-floor noise in a building is difficult for human hearing. A convolutional neural network-based inter-floor noise type/position classification method was proposed in [Appl. Sci. 9, 3735 (2019)] to identify inter-floor noise. The method was evaluated against inter-floor noise collected in a single campus building as a feasibility test. In this work, the generalizability of the method was addressed through numerous tasks using new datasets collected in two real apartment buildings. These datasets contain inter-floor noise generated in rooms and at positions with three-dimensional spatial diversity, which was not studied in the previous work. Furthermore, type classification knowledge transfer between two individual apartment building domains was studied.},

  abstract = {Dementia is a chronic syndrome characterized by deteriorating cognitive functions, thereby impacting the person's daily life. It is often confused with decline in normal behavior due to natural aging and hence is hard to diagnose. Although, prior research has shown that dementia affects the subject's speech, but it is not studied which frequency bands are being affected, and up to what extent, that in turn might influence identifying the different stages of dementia automatically. This work investigates the acoustic cues in different subsampled speech signals, to automatically differentiate Healthy Controls (HC) from stages of dementia such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We use the Pitt corpus of DementiaBank database, to identify a set of features best suited for distinguishing between HC, MCI and AD speech, and achieve an F-score of 0.857 which is an absolute improvement of 2.8% over the state of the art.},

  abstract = {In the context of monitoring respiratory diseases, an unobtrusive cough monitor is an attractive tool. Preferably, such tool requires little or no customization. We address the question of the feasibility of such a device. A large database of sounds including coughs and other events was available. Using deep learning, a general cough classifier was constructed. The plug-and-play feasibility of such cough classifier is addressed by a leave-one-patient-out procedure. For a large part of the cohort (80%), the performance of the classifier is excellent meaning an area under the curve (AUC) of larger than 0.9. On top of that, estimates are derived for its success in practical scenarios by considering the prevalence of cough and the required specificity. It is shown that the acoustic environment can be harsh, requiring very high specificities. From the results, we argue that for real-world applications customization will be required. For part of the population, it suffices to set a patient-specific operation point in generic cough classifier, but for some part a personalized cough classifier will be needed.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning methodologies are making a remarkable contribution, and yielding state-of-the-art results in different speech domains. With this exceptionally significant achievement, a large amount of labeled data is the largest bottleneck in the deployment of these speech systems. To generate massive data, hand-labeling training data is an intensively laborious task. This is problematic for clinical applications where obtaining such data labeled by speech pathologists is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we introduce a new paradigm called Weak Speech Supervision (WSS), a first-of-its-kind system that helps users to train state-of-the-art classification models without hand-labeling training data. Users can write labeling functions (i.e., weak rules) to generate weak data from the unlabeled training set. In this paper, we provide the efficiency of this methodology via showing the case study of the severity-based binary classification of dysarthric speech. In WSS, we train a classifier on trusted data (labeled with 100% accuracy) via utilizing the weak data (labeled using weak supervision) to make our classifier model more efficient. Analysis of the proposed methodology is performed on Universal Access (UA) corpus. We got on an average 35.68% and 43.83% relative improvement in terms of accuracy and F1-score w.r.t. baselines, respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with developing a method of detecting right whales from autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) that is robust to changing operating conditions. A baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) is first trained using data taken from a single operating condition. Its detection accuracy is then found to degrade when applied to different operating conditions. Two methods are then investigated to restore performance using just a single model. The first method is an augmented training approach where progressively more data from the new condition is mixed with the original data. The second method uses unsupervised adaptation to adapt the original model to the new conditions. Evaluation under changing environmental and noise conditions reveals the model produced from augmented training data to achieve higher detection accuracy across all conditions than the adapted model. However, the adapted model does not require label data from the new environment and in these situations is a more realistic solution.},

In contrast to existing works, the proposed cough discrimination models are trained and tested with heterogeneous data uploaded by different users to online audio repositories. In that way, our system achieves robust performance to a wide range of audio recording devices and to varying noise and/or reverberation conditions.

Assessing the severity level of dysarthria, apart from being a diagnostic step to evaluate the patient's improvement, is also capable of aiding automatic dysarthric speech recognition systems. In this paper, a detailed study on dysarthia severity classification using various deep learning architectural choices, namely deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is carried out. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and its derivatives are used as features. Performance of these models are compared with a baseline support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the UA-Speech corpus and the TORGO database. The highest classification accuracy of 96.18% and 93.24% are reported for TORGO and UA-Speech respectively. Detailed analysis on performance of these models shows that a proper choice of a deep learning architecture can ensure better performance than the conventionally used SVM classifier.},

We show that the least squares criterion on subband errors regularized by a p-norm-like diversity measure can be used to simultaneously decorrelate the speech signals and exploit sparsity of the acoustic feedback path impulse response. Compared with traditional subband adaptive filters that are not appropriate for incorporating sparsity due to shorter sub-filters, our proposed framework is suitable for promoting sparse characteristics, as the update rule utilizing subband information actually operates in the fullband. Simulation results show that the normalized misalignment, added stable gain, and other objective metrics of the AFC are significantly improved by choosing a proper sparsity promoting factor and a suitable number of subbands. More importantly, the results indicate that the benefits of subband decomposition and sparsity promoting are complementary and additive for AFC in HAs.},

  pages = {126-130},
  abstract = {Currently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) define the state of the art for multipitch tracking in music signals. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a recently introduced recurrent neural network architecture, achieved similar results as CNNs for various tasks, such as phoneme or digit recognition. However, they have not yet received much attention in the community of Music Information Retrieval. The core of ESNs is a group of unordered, randomly connected neurons, i.e., the reservoir, by which the low-dimensional input space is non-linearly transformed into a high-dimensional feature space. Because only the weights of the connections between the reservoir and the output are trained using linear regression, ESNs are easier to train than deep neural networks. This paper presents a first exploration of ESNs for the challenging task of multipitch tracking in music signals. The best results presented in this paper were achieved with a bidirectional two-layer ESN with 20 000 neurons in each layer. Although the final F-score of 0.7198 still falls below the state of the art (0.7370), the proposed ESN-based approach serves as a baseline for further investigations of ESNs in audio signal processing in the future.},

The implementation of nonlinear elements in Wave Digital Filters (WDFs) is usually restricted to just one nonlinear one-port per structure. However, recent advances led to a strictly modular realization of multiple nonlinearities by identification of contractivity properties of WDFs, allowing an assured converging iterative procedure, which depends on the presence of artificial port resistances. In this paper, an enhanced semi-modular approach based on Multi-dimensional WDFs (MDWDFs) is presented for the realization of multiple nonlinearities. Therefore, the concept of Automatic Differentiating WDFs (ADWDFs) is extended for nonlinearities as a novel approach to overcome convergence speed limitations induced by said port resistances, making the proposed method virtually independent of the same.},

However, as far as the implementation of circuits with multiple nonlinearities is concerned, much research effort is still needed in order to develop systematic strategies for solving the corresponding multivariate systems of implicit equations with low computational requirements. In this regard, this paper discusses the computational cost of the Scattering Iterative Method (SIM), a recently proposed iterative fixed-point algorithm that works in the Wave Digital domain and it is capable of handling circuits with J one-port nonlinearities using J separate local solvers. In the light of the computational cost analysis, we also propose a refinement of SIM relying on the so called Dynamic Scattering Matrix Recomputation (DSR) procedure. The DSR procedure significantly improves the performance of the algorithm, paving the way toward Virtual Analog applications in which SIM-based audio plugins emulating nonlinear circuits run in real-time.},

However, the majority of that is dealing with monophonic music, while efforts on polyphonic material mainly focus on predominant instrument recognition. In this paper, we propose an approach for instrument classification in polyphonic music from predominantly monophonic data that involves performing data augmentation by mixing different audio segments. A variety of data augmentation techniques focusing on different sonic aspects, such as overlaying audio segments of the same genre, as well as pitch and tempo-based synchronization, are explored. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks for the classification task, comparing shallow to deep network architectures. We further investigate the usage of a combination of the above classifiers, each trained on a single augmented dataset. An ensemble of VGG-like classifiers, trained on non-augmented, pitch-synchronized, tempo-synchronized and genre-similar excerpts, respectively, yields the best results, achieving slightly above 80% in terms of label ranking average precision (LRAP) in the IRMAS test set.},

Algorithms designed to monitor the tempo of a musical recording have thus far been optimized for music with relatively stable rhythms, repetitive structures, and consistent melodies; these algorithms typically struggle to follow the free-form nature of improvisational music. Here, we present a multi-agent improvisation beat tracker (MAIBT) that addresses the challenges posed by improvisations and compare its performance with other state-of-the-art methods on a unique data set collected during improvisational music therapy sessions. This algorithm is designed for MIDI files and proceeds in four stages: (1) preprocessing to remove notes that are timid and overlapping, (2) clustering of the remaining notes and subsequent ranking of the clusters, (3) agent initialization and performance-based selection, and (4) artificial beat insertion and deletion to fill remaining beat gaps and create a comprehensive beat sequence. This particular method performs better than other generic beat-tracking approaches for music that lacks regularity; it is thus well suited to applications where unpredictability and inaccuracy are predominant, such as in music therapy improvisation.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {171-175},
  abstract = {Detecting the onset of notes in music excerpts is a fundamental problem in many music signal processing tasks, including analysis, synthesis, and information retrieval. When addressing the note onset detection (NOD) problem using a data-driven methodology, a major challenge is the availability and quality of labeled datasets used for both model training/tuning and evaluation. As most of the available datasets are manually annotated, the amount of annotated music excerpts is limited and the annotation strategy and quality varies across data sets. To counter both problems, in this paper we propose to use semi-synthetic datasets where the music excerpts are mixes of isolated note recordings. The advantage resides in the annotations being automatically generated while mixing the notes, as isolated note onsets are straightforward to detect using a simple energy measure. A semi-synthetic dataset is used in this work for augmenting a real piano dataset when training a convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three novel model training strategies. Training the CNN on a semi-synthetic dataset and retraining only the CNN classification layers on a real dataset results in higher average F1-score (F1) scores with lower variance.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {176-180},
  abstract = {The use of wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) has received increased attention over the last decade. The advantages of WASNs over stand-alone multi-microphone devices are that the microphone array is not anymore limited by the dimensions of a single device, and that microphones can be placed at arbitrary locations. One of the disadvantages, however, is that for many applications, like beamforming, the clocks of all devices in the network need to be synchronised and that the microphone gains need to be equalised. In this paper we will prove that a specific class of beamformers is clock-offset and gain mismatch invariant. The parameters for these beamformers (acoustic transfer function and power spectral density matrices) can be estimated directly from the uncalibrated microphone signals, instead of first synchronising the clocks and equalising the gains and then estimating them. The resulting beamformers are applied to the non-calibrated microphone signals. We will substantiate, by means of computer simulations, that the proposed approach gives identical results compared to the setup where microphone signals are first calibrated, so that clock-offset compensation and microphone gain equalisation becomes unnecessary.},

  pages = {181-185},
  abstract = {Microphone arrays are widely used for speech enhancement applications. We consider the enhancement of multiple desired speakers in a noisy environment while utilizing the Relative Transfer Function (RTF) approach for the beamformer realization. When beamforming operation relies on an estimated RTF, it produces a signal with reduced noise compared to the signal received by some reference microphone associated with the RTF, while maintaining its speech component undistorted. The reference microphone is usually chosen as the microphone with the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). For large arrays, in a multiple desired speaker environment, there is no single reference microphone which maximizes SNR for all desired speakers. The commonly used RTF technique may result in compromised performance for one or more desired speakers. Here, we propose an alternative scheme that considers multiple reference microphones. Each reference microphone is associated with a single desired speaker such that it maximizes its input SNR, in comparison to other array microphones. We show that by this technique, the beamformer maintains the desired noise reduction without compromising SNR for any of the desired speakers. We present analytical analysis for a 2 microphone array in free-field propagation for far-field sources. Based on this analysis some design criteria are derived and finally evaluated both in synthetic and recorded room environments.},

  abstract = {The importance of soundfield imaging techniques is expected to further increase in the next few years thanks to the ever-increasing availability of low-cost sensors such as MEMS microphones. When it comes to processing a relevant number of sensor signals, however, the computational load of space-time processing algorithms easily grows to unmanageable levels. The Ray Space Transform (RST) was recently introduced as a promising tool for soundfield analysis. Given the collection of signals captured by a uniform linear array of microphones, the RST allows us to collect and map the directional components of the acoustic field onto a domain called {"}ray space{"}, where relevant acoustic objects are represented as linear patterns for advanced acoustic analysis and synthesis applications. So far the computational complexity of the RST linearly increases with the number of microphones. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose an alternative efficient implementation of the RST based on the Non Uniform Fast Fourier Transform.},

  pages = {191-195},
  abstract = {Power spectral density (PSD) estimates of various microphone signal components are essential to many speech enhancement procedures. As speech is highly non-nonstationary, performance improvements may be gained by maintaining time-variations in PSD estimates. In this paper, we propose an instantaneous PSD estimation approach based on generalized principal components. Similarly to other eigenspace-based PSD estimation approaches, we rely on recursive averaging in order to obtain a microphone signal correlation matrix estimate to be decomposed. However, instead of estimating the PSDs directly from the temporally smooth generalized eigenvalues of this matrix, yielding temporally smooth PSD estimates, we propose to estimate the PSDs from newly defined instantaneous generalized eigenvalues, yielding instantaneous PSD estimates. The instantaneous generalized eigenvalues are defined from the generalized principal components, i.e. a generalized eigenvector-based transform of the microphone signals. We further show that the smooth generalized eigenvalues can be understood as a recursive average of the instantaneous generalized eigenvalues. Simulation results comparing the multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) with smooth and instantaneous PSD estimates indicate better speech enhancement performance for the latter. A MATLAB implementation is available online.},

Signal diffuseness information from acoustic signals is aggregated via the coherent-to-diffuse power ratio to obtain a distance-related feature, which is mapped to a source-to-microphone distance estimate by means of a DNN. This information is then combined with direction-of-arrival estimates from compact microphone arrays to infer the geometry of the sensor network. Unlike many other approaches to geometry calibration, the proposed scheme does only require that the sampling clocks of the sensor nodes are roughly synchronized. In simulations we show that the proposed DNN-based distance estimator generalizes to unseen acoustic environments and that precise estimates of the sensor node positions are obtained.},

  pages = {201-205},
  abstract = {Microphone leakage occurs in multichannel close-talk audio recordings of a meeting, when speech of an active speaker couples into both the dedicated target microphone and all other microphone channels. For an automatic transcription or analysis of a meeting, the interferer signals in the target microphone channels have to be eliminated. Therefore, we apply a frequency domain adaptive filtering-based multichannel acoustic echo cancellation (MAEC) method, which typically requires clean reference channels. We consider a wide range of different speech-to-interferer ratios and evaluate two cascading schemes for the MAEC, which leads to an improved speech component quality and interferer reduction by up to 0.1MOS points and 0.5dB, respectively. However, the purpose of this work is not to improve the MAEC method, but instead to show that it can be successfully applied to microphone leakage reduction, such as in meetings with headset-equipped participants. Therefore, we analyze and point out why the MAEC method is able to cancel the interferer signals in this scenario even though the reference signals are themselves disturbed by interfering speech portions.},

The mask predictions are provided by a neural network, fed with rough estimations of speech and noise amplitude spectra, under the assumption of known directions of arrival. This study evaluates the replacing of the recurrent LSTM network previously investigated by a convolutive U-net under more stressing conditions with an additional second competitive speaker. We show that, due to more accurate short-term masks prediction, the U-net architecture brings some improvements in terms of word error rate. Moreover, results indicate that the use of dilated convolutive layers is beneficial in difficult situations with two interfering speakers, and/or where the target and interferences are close to each other in terms of the angular distance. Moreover, these results come with a two-fold reduction in the number of parameters.},

One of the most used techniques for this purpose is the Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) between a pair of signals and its use in Steered Response Power (SRP) techniques, which estimate the acoustic power at a specific location. Nowadays, Deep Learning strategies may outperform these methods. However, they are generally dependent on the geometric and sensor configuration conditions that are available during the training phases, thus having limited generalization capabilities when facing new environments if no re-training nor adaptation is applied. In this work, we propose a method based on an encoder-decoder CNN architecture capable of outperforming the well known SRP-PHAT algorithm, and also other Deep Learning strategies when working in mismatched training-testing conditions without requiring a model re-training. Our proposal aims to estimate a smoothed version of the correlation signals, that is then used to generate a refined acoustic power map, which leads to better performance on the ASL task. Our experimental evaluation uses three publicly available realistic datasets and provides a comparison with the SRP-PHAT algorithm and other recent proposals based on Deep Learning.},

In this work, a multi-channel audio signal is encoded to a latent representation, which is subsequently decoded to a sequence of estimated directions-of-arrival.

The framework is evaluated on three publicly available datasets for sound event localization. It yields superior localization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both anechoic and reverberant conditions.},

Trilateration, triangulation, and multilateration are three widely-used techniques for localization depending on the available information. The main drawbacks of these methods are the requirements of a large number of anchors and an elaborately designed layout. To accomplish the localization task with minimal resources while maintaining reasonable accuracy, we propose a 3-D source localization method with a compact infrastructure (prototype realized with 4 anchors located within an area of 2.5×20 cm2) by utilizing only phase-difference information. The proposed method first estimates the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the target and then finds the candidate 3-D location along on the DOA by minimizing a cost function. This system is compared to the other two similar setups based on simulations and the experimental tests are carried out using acoustic waves. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve 3-D location error of 2.77 cm for a target at 0.5 m without synchronization between the transmitter and the receivers. The relatively small system size and sufficient location accuracy provide possibilities in controller tracking for virtual reality applications.},

Audiovisual tracking is used to know people’s position in the environment and if they are talking, through the use of cameras and microphones. In this work we present an audiovisual tracking solution with a single camera and microphone array in a distributed configuration. Our idea is to exploit the estimation of azimuth and elevation from audio information to be fused with the position estimation obtained from a Viola and Jones based observation model. The fact that the microphone array is not co-located with the camera will allow to reduce the distance estimation uncertainty from the video model and improve tracking accuracy. The system was evaluated on the AV16.3 database on single speaker sequences, outperforming results of state-of-the-art, under these conditions.},

  pages = {261-265},
  abstract = {Deep neural networks with convolutional layers usually process the entire spectrogram of an audio signal with the same time-frequency resolutions, number of filters, and dimensionality reduction scale. According to the constant-Q transform, good features can be extracted from audio signals if the low frequency bands are processed with high frequency resolution filters and the high frequency bands with high time resolution filters. In the spectrogram of a mixture of singing voices and music signals, there is usually more information about the voice in the low frequency bands than the high frequency bands. These raise the need for processing each part of the spectrogram differently. In this paper, we propose a multi-band multi-resolution fully convolutional neural network (MBR-FCN) for singing voice separation. The MBR-FCN processes the frequency bands that have more information about the target signals with more filters and smaller dimensionality reduction scale than the bands with less information. Furthermore, the MBR-FCN processes the low frequency bands with high frequency resolution filters and the high frequency bands with high time resolution filters. Our experimental results show that the proposed MBR-FCN with very few parameters achieves better singing voice separation performance than other deep neural networks.},

In the speech source separation technique, estimation of a covariance matrix is a highly important part. Recent studies showed that it is effective to estimate the covariance matrix by multiplying cross-correlation of microphone input signal with a time-frequency mask (TFM) inferred by the DNN. However, this assumption is not valid actually and overlapping of multiple speech sources lead to degradation of estimation accuracy of the multi-channel covariance matrix. Instead, we propose a multichannel covariance matrix estimation technique which estimates the covariance matrix by a TFM for the separated speech signal by the unsupervised spatial filtering. Pre-filtered signal can reduce overlapping of multiple speech sources and increase estimation accuracy of the covariance matrix. Experimental results show that the proposed estimation technique of the multichannel covariance matrix is effective.},

Our probabilistic approach is based on Gaussian priors for the speech signals, Gamma hyperpriors for the speech precisions and a Gamma prior for the noise precision. The time-varying acoustic channels are modelled with a linear-Gaussian state-space model. The inference is carried out using a variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm, leading to a variant of the multi-speaker multichannel Wiener filter (MCWF) to separate and enhance the audio sources, and a Kalman smoother to infer the acoustic channels. The VEM speech estimator can be decomposed into two stages: A multi-speaker linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer followed by a variational multi-speaker postfilter. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a static scenario using recorded room impulse responses (RIRs) with two reverberation levels, showing superior performance compared to competing methods.},

  abstract = {Acoustic source separation has been an active and important area of research in the field of acoustic signal processing. This paper deals with this problem using small and compact differential microphone arrays (DMAs) so that the resulting technology can be used in a broad range of small devices in voice communication and human-machine interfaces. A straightforward way to achieve source separation with DMAs is through differential beamforming. Although it has frequency-invariant beampatterns and high directivity in comparison with other existing beamforming methods with the same number of sensors, differential beamforming with small DMAs has limited spatial gain, generally leading to insufficient separation performance. To circumvent this limitation, we propose in this work a method to combine differential beamforming with an independent vector analysis (IVA) based algorithm. Specifically, differential beamformers are designed and applied to separate sound sources from different directions. Then, differential beamformers’ outputs are used as inputs for the independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) algorithm, a widely used IVA method for blind source separation. The advantage of this proposed method consists of at least three aspects: 1) improving the source separation performance, 2) helping deal with the permutation problem, and 3) helping improve the convergence of ILRMA.},

  abstract = {Independent vector analysis (IVA) minimizes an objective function to estimate separation filters that separate mixture signals into individual source signals. Unfortunately, IVA often suffers from the well-known block permutation problem. To mitigate that problem, the use of geometry knowledge has been studied, but two crucial issues remain: the necessity of non-differential processes outside the minimization and of high-level geometrical clues such as the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the source signals. This paper thus presents a novel IVA method whose objective function has a differentiable max-directivity beamforming normalization (MDBN) term. This term uses geometry knowledge from only a low-level geometrical clue (the positions of the microphone array) via the traditional beamforming (BF) concept that each separation filter should have a maximum gain for each specific DOA across all frequency bins. Thus, our overall objective function can be minimized by gradient descent, and the MDBN term encourages the separation filters to focus on specific directions, which implicitly estimates the most reasonable DOAs of the source signals at each iteration. Therefore, our method uses geometry knowledge while avoiding the above two issues and estimates good separation filters mitigating the permutation problem. Several experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional BF and IVA methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) of three or more sources that is faster than that for conventional ILRMA. In conventional ILRMA, demixing vectors are updated one by one by the iterative projection (IP) method. The update rules of IP are derived from a system of quadratic equations obtained by differentiating the objective function of ILRMA with respect to demixing vectors. This system of quadratic equations is called hybrid exact-approximate joint diagonalization (HEAD) and no closed-form solution is known yet for three or more sources. Recently, a method that can update two demixing vectors simultaneously has been proposed for independent vector analysis. The method is derived by reducing HEAD for two sources to a generalized eigenvalue problem and solving the problem. Furthermore, the pairwise updates have recently been extended to the case of three or more sources. However, the efficacy of the pairwise updates for ILRMA has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this work, we apply the pairwise updates of demixing vectors to ILRMA. By replacing the update rules of demixing vectors with the proposed pairwise updates, we accelerate the convergence of ILRMA. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields faster convergence and better performance than conventional ILRMA.},

A typical approach to BSS is to integrate a low-rank source model with a full-rank spatial model as multichannel NMF (MNMF) based on full-rank spatial covariance matrices (CMs) or its efficient version named FastMNMF based on jointly-diagonalizable spatial CMs do. The NMF-based phase-unaware source model, however, can deal with only the positive cooccurrence relations between time-frequency bins. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient multichannel extension of correlated tensor factorization (CTF) named FastMCTF based on jointly-diagonalizable temporal, frequency, and spatial CMs. Integration of the jointly-diagonalizable full-rank source model proposed by FastCTF with the jointly-diagonalizable full-rank spatial model proposed by FastMNMF enables us to completely consider the positive and negative covariance relations between frequency bins, time frames, and channels. We derive a convergence-guaranteed parameter estimation algorithm based on the multiplicative update and iterative projection and experimentally show the potential of the proposed method.},

In view of this, we in this paper contextualize and enhance the state-of-the-art BERT-based model for speech summarization, while its contributions are at least three-fold. First, we explore the incorporation of confidence scores into sentence representations to see if such an attempt could help alleviate the negative effects caused by imperfect automatic speech recognition (ASR). Secondly, we also augment the sentence embeddings obtained from BERT with extra structural and linguistic features, such as sentence position and inverse document frequency (IDF) statistics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a benchmark dataset, in comparison to several classic and celebrated speech summarization methods.},

The components of the architecture, namely the shared encoder, the attention decoder’s long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, and the soft-max layers of the CTC part and attention part, are adapted separately or together using limited amount of adaptation data. When adapting the shared encoder, we propose to adapt only the connections of the memory cells in the memory blocks of bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) layers to improve performance and reduce the time for adapting the models. In within-domain and cross-domain adaptation scenarios, experimental results show that adaptation of end-to-end speech recognition using the hybrid CTC/Attention architecture is effective even when the amount of adaptation data is limited. In cross-domain adaptation, substantial performance improvement can be achieved with only 2.4 minutes of adaptation data. In both adaptation scenarios, adapting only the memory cells of the BLSTM layers in the shared encoder yields comparable or slightly better performance while yielding smaller adaptation time than the adaptation of other components or the whole architecture, especially when the amount of adaptation data is less than or equal to 10 minutes.},

Consequently, with greater or lesser success, optimal filterbank learning has been studied for different speech processing tasks.

Two approaches are examined: filterbank matrix learning in the power spectral domain and parameter learning of a psychoacoustically-motivated gammachirp filterbank. Filterbank parameters are optimized jointly with a modern deep residual neural network-based KWS back-end. Our experimental results reveal that, in general, there are no statistically significant differences, in terms of KWS accuracy, between using a learned filterbank and handcrafted speech features. Thus, while we conclude that the latter are still a wise choice when using modern KWS back-ends, we also hypothesize that this could be a symptom of information redundancy, which opens up new research possibilities in the field of small-footprint KWS.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {341-345},
  abstract = {For many small- and medium-vocabulary tasks, audio-visual speech recognition can significantly improve the recognition rates compared to audio-only systems. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding the best combination strategy for multi-modal information, which should allow for the translation of these gains to large-vocabulary recognition. While an integration at the level of state-posterior probabilities, using dynamic stream weighting, is almost universally helpful for small-vocabulary systems, in large-vocabulary speech recognition, the recognition accuracy remains difficult to improve. In the following, we specifically consider the large-vocabulary task of the LRS2 database, and we investigate a broad range of integration strategies, comparing early integration and end-to-end learning with many versions of hybrid recognition and dynamic stream weighting. One aspect, which is shown to provide much benefit here, is the use of dynamic stream reliability indicators, which allow for hybrid architectures to strongly profit from the inclusion of visual information whenever the audio channel is distorted even slightly.},

  pages = {346-350},
  abstract = {We investigate the effect of speaker localization on the performance of speech recognition systems in a multispeaker, multichannel environment. Given the speaker location information, speech separation is performed in three stages. In the first stage, a simple delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer is used to enhance the signal impinging from the speaker location which is then used to estimate a time-frequency mask corresponding to the localized speaker using a neural network. This mask is used to compute the second order statistics and to derive an adaptive beamformer in the third stage. We generated a multichannel, multispeaker, reverberated, noisy dataset inspired from the well studied WSJ0-2mix and study the performance of the proposed pipeline in terms of the word error rate (WER). An average WER of 29.4% was achieved using the ground truth localization information and 42.4% using the localization information estimated via GCC-PHAT. Though higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) between the speakers was found to positively impact the speech separation performance, equivalent performances were obtained for mixtures with lower SIR values when the speakers are well separated in space.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an attention-based CNN-BLSTM model with the end-to-end (E2E) learning method. We first extract Mel-spectrogram from wav file instead of using handcrafted features. Then we adopt two types of attention mechanisms to let the model focuses on salient periods of speech emotions over the temporal dimension. Considering that there are many individual differences among people in expressing emotions, we incorporate speaker recognition as an auxiliary task. Moreover, since the training data set has a small sample size, we include data from another language as data augmentation. We evaluated the proposed method on SAVEE dataset by training it with single task, multitask, and cross-language. The evaluation shows that our proposed model achieves 73.62% for weighted accuracy and 71.11% for un-weighted accuracy in the task of speech emotion recognition, which outperforms the baseline with 11.13 points.},

  abstract = {In state-of-the-art end-to-end Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers are typically used to extract affective features while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers model long-term temporal dependencies. However, these systems suffer from several problems: 1) the model largely ignores temporal structure in speech due to the limited receptive field of the CNN layers, 2) the model inherits the drawbacks of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)s, e.g. the gradient exploding/vanishing problem, the polynomial growth of computation time with the input sequence length and the lack of parallelizability. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end SER structure that does not contain any recurrent or fully connected layers. By levering the power of the dilated causal convolution, the receptive field of the proposed model largely increases with reasonably low computational cost. By also using context stacking, the proposed model is capable of exploiting long-term temporal dependencies and can be an alternative to RNN. Experiments on the RECOLA database publicly available partition show improved results compare to a state-of-the-art system. We also verify that both the proposed model and the state-of-the-art model learned from short sequences (i.e.20s) can make accurate predictions for very long sequences (e.g. ≥ 75s).},

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {The SincNet architecture [1] was recently introduced as an approach to the speaker recognition task. Its main innovation was the sinc layer—an elegant and lightweight way of extracting features from speech. Despite good performance on multiple datasets, little information was provided on the architectural choices. In this work, we aim to shed some light on the importance of the network topology and various hyperparameters. We replace the original network trunk with a lightweight trunk inspired from residual networks (ResNets) and optimize its hyperparameters. Furthermore, we carry an extensive study on the sinc layer’s hyperparameters. Our main finding is that the stride and window size of the feature extractor plays a crucial role in obtaining good performance. Further experiments on conventional features, such as MFCCs and FBANKs, yield similar conclusions; in fact, by using optimal values for these two hyperparameters, traditional features are able to match the performance of sinc features. Surprisingly, the best results obtained go against conventional wisdom: an analysis window of only a couple of milliseconds and a stride of only a couple of samples are found to give the best results. Our code is available at https://bitbucket.org/doneata/sincnet.},

Although another level of performance has been overcome with this approach, fine-tuning and optimizing the hyper-parameters of a deep neural network to obtain a robust x-vector extractor is cost- and time-consuming. Several approaches have been proposed to train robust x-vector extractors. In this paper, we propose to review and analyse the impact of the most significant x-vector related approaches, including variations in terms of data augmentation, number of epochs, size of mini-batch, acoustic features and frames per iteration. By applying these approaches to the default recipe provided in the Kaldi toolkit, we observed a significant relative gain of more than 50% in terms of EER on Speaker in the Wild and Voxceleb1-E datasets.},

In order to improve the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, it is very important to analyze the mismatched training and testing situations and propose a robust acoustic features to enhance the whisper recognition. In this paper we propose to use Teager Energy Cepstral Coefficients (TECC) which uses Teager Energy Operator (TEO) for estimating {"}true{"} total energy of the signal, i.e., the sum of kinetic and potential energies which is contradictory to the traditional signal energy approximation, which only takes kinetic energy into account, i.e., L2 norm of the signal. In this study, experiments are performed on wTIMIT and CHAINS corpus. For wTIMIT corpus, frame-level accuracy of 92.22 % is obtained and for CHAINS corpus, it is 95.61 %. We have also estimated the performance measure of the classifier by using Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), F-measure, and J-statistics. Furthermore, experiments are performed by considering latency period from a practical deployment viewpoint, and the trade-off between latency period vs. accuracy is discussed for both the corpora.},

  abstract = {The explosion of available speech data and new speaker modeling methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) have given the ability to develop more robust speaker recognition systems. Among DNN speaker modelling techniques, x-vector system has shown a degree of robustness in noisy environments. Previous studies suggest that by increasing the number of speakers in the training data and using data augmentation more robust speaker recognition systems are achievable in noisy environments. In this work, we want to know if explicit noise compensation techniques continue to be effective despite the general noise robustness of these systems. For this study, we will use two different x-vector networks: the first one is trained on Voxceleb1 (Protocol1), and the second one is trained on Voxceleb1+Voxveleb2 (Protocol2). We propose to add a denoising x-vector subsystem before scoring. Experimental results show that, the x-vector system used in Protocol2 is more robust than the other one used Protocol1. Despite this observation we will show that explicit noise compensation gives almost the same EER relative gain in both protocols. For example, in the Protocol2 we have 21% to 66% improvement of EER with denoising techniques.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of speaker segmentation and diarization normally makes use of forgiveness collars around ground truth speaker segment boundaries such that estimated speaker segment boundaries with such collars are considered completely correct. This paper shows that the popular recent approach of removing forgiveness collars from speaker diarization evaluation tools can unfairly penalize speaker diarization systems that correctly estimate speaker segment boundaries. The uncertainty in identifying the start and/or end of a particular phoneme means that the ground truth segmentation is not perfectly accurate, and even trained human listeners are unable to identify phoneme boundaries with full consistency. This research analyses the phoneme dependence of this uncertainty, and shows that it depends on (i) whether the phoneme being detected is at the start or end of an utterance and (ii) what the phoneme is, so that the use of a uniform forgiveness collar is inadequate. This analysis is expected to point the way towards more indicative and repeatable assessment of the performance of speaker diarization systems.},

  abstract = {Voice Assistant (VA) now-a-days plays a very important role for the smart home applications. However, the VA along with ease also brings security issue too, such as possibility of being attacked by replay, hidden voice commands, etc. This paper presents replay Spoof Speech Detection (SSD) system for VA using Energy Separation Algorithm (ESA)-based features to capture Instantaneous Amplitude and Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (i.e., ESA-IACC and ESA-IFCC), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a pattern classifier. Teager Energy Operator (TEO) has the characteristics to suppress the noise and hence, it is robust to noise sensitivity. For noisy acoustic environment, the ESA-based features that employ TEO perform well compared to the clean environment. We performed the experiments on the ReMASC database, which contains four different acoustic environments. Proposed features performed better in clean and noisy environments. In addition, to obtain possible complementary information, we performed score-level fusion of ESA-IACC and ESA-IFCC that resulted in low Equal Error Rate (EER) for different environments. Furthermore, we compared our proposed feature sets with Constant-Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC), and Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC) resulting in an relative improvement of approximately 21.88 % for clean environments and 66.34 % for noisy environments (in EER), respectively.},

Taco-VC is implemented using a single speaker Tacotron synthesizer based on Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) and a single speaker WaveNet vocoder conditioned on mel spectrograms. To enhance the converted speech quality, and to overcome over-smoothing, the outputs of Tacotron are passed through a novel speech-enhancement network, which is composed of a combination of the phoneme recognition and Tacotron networks. Our system is trained just with a single speaker corpus and adapts to new speakers using only a few minutes of training data. Using mid-size public datasets, our method outperforms the baseline in the VCC 2018 SPOKE non-parallel voice conversion task and achieves competitive results compared to multi-speaker networks trained on large private datasets.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {396-400},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a low-latency speech enhancement technique for electrolaryngeal (EL) speech based on multi-task CLDNN. Although the EL speech can generate relatively intelligible speech, laryngectomees always suffer quality degradation of speech naturalness due to the mechanical excitation signals. To solve this problem, an EL speech enhancement technique based on CLDNN consisting of convolution, recurrent, and fully connected layers has been proposed. In this technique, an input feature vector of the EL speech is converted into several vocoder parameters such as excitation parameters and spectral parameters based on expert CLDNNs optimized for each feature. However, it is difficult to utilize speech communication because its bi-directional recurrent layers cause a large delay to wait for the end of the utterance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose multi-task CLDNN with uni-directional recurrent layers for the low-latency EL speech enhancement. Moreover, to achieve comparable performance to the bi-directional CLDNN, we also propose the following techniques: 1) knowledge distillation, 2) data augmentation, and 3) phonetic regularization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method makes it possible to achieve comparable objective results to the bi-directional CLDNN and outperform naturalness and speech intelligibility in the noisy condition.},

Here we introduce a semi-supervised training strategy that allows refining the estimator by means of an analysis-synthesis setup using real speech signals, for which GCI ground truth does not exist. Evaluation of the analyser is performed by means of comparing the GCI extracted from the glottal flow signal generated by the analyser with the GCI extracted from EGG on the CMU arctic dataset, where EGG signals were recorded in addition to speech. We observe that (1.) the artificial increase of the diversity of pulse shapes that has been used in our previous construction of the synthetic database is beneficial, (2.) training the GCI network in the analysis-synthesis setup allows achieving a very significant improvement of the GCI analyser, (3.) additional regularisation strategies allow improving the final analysis network when trained in the analysis-synthesis setup.},

  pages = {411-415},
  abstract = {Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)based methods have shown remarkable performance for the Voice Conversion and WHiSPer-to-normal SPeeCH (WHSP2SPCH) conversion. One of the key challenges in WHSP2SPCH conversion is the prediction of fundamental frequency (F0). Recently, authors have proposed state-of-the-art method Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for WHSP2SPCH conversion. The CycleGAN-based method uses two different models, one for Mel Cepstral Coefficients (MCC) mapping, and another for F0 prediction, where F0 is highly dependent on the pre-trained model of MCC mapping. This leads to additional nonlinear noise in predicted F0. To suppress this noise, we propose Cycle-in-Cycle GAN (i.e., CinC-GAN). It is specially designed to increase the effectiveness in F0 prediction without losing the accuracy of MCC mapping. We evaluated the proposed method on a non-parallel setting and analyzed on speaker-specific, and gender-specific tasks. The objective and subjective tests show that CinC-GAN significantly outperforms the CycleGAN. In addition, we analyze the CycleGAN and CinC-GAN for unseen speakers and the results show the clear superiority of CinC-GAN.},

In this paper, we presume direct implantation of voiced phonemes in whispered speech and we focus on fully flexible parametric models that i) can be independently controlled, ii) synthesize natural and linguistically correct voiced phonemes, iii) preserve idiosyncratic characteristics of a given speaker, and iv) are amenable to co-articulation effects through simple model interpolation. We use natural spoken and sung vowels to illustrate these capabilities in a signal modeling and re-synthesis process where spectral magnitude, phase structure, F0 contour and sound morphing can be independently controlled in arbitrary ways.},

We denote the absolute values and signs of the DCT spectral coefficients as the Absolute Spectrum (AS) and Polarity Spectrum (PoS), respectively. We theoretically show that the noisy PoS is the best estimate of the original, under the constrained MMSE criterion. To verify this experimentally, the effect of using the noisy PoS for signal resynthesis is analysed through objective and subjective measures. The results show that when the Instantaneous SNR (ISNR) is above 0 dB, deemed as perfect, recovery of the original speech signal can be obtained only by modifying the DCT absolute spectrum. However, an accurate DFT Phase Spectrum (PhS) estimation might be required to achieve the same improvement in perceived speech quality. When the perceived quality is measured against the Segmental SNR (SSNR), it shows the PoS is more capable to conserve the speech quality than the PhS for the same level of global distortion. The results show that the noisy PoS can be used as an estimate of the clean PoS without perceivable degradation in speech quality, only if the ISNR of the noisy speech signal is above 0 dB or the SSNR is above 10.5 dB.},

  abstract = {A blind bandwidth extension is presented which improves the perceived quality of 4 kHz speech by artificially extending the speech’s frequency range to 8 kHz. Based on the source-filter model of the human speech production, the speech signal is decomposed into spectral envelope and excitation signal and each of them is extrapolated separately. With this decomposition, good perceptual quality can be achieved while keeping the computational complexity low. The focus of this work is in the generation of an excitation signal with and autoregressive model that calculates a distribution for each audio sample conditioned on previous samples. This is achieved with a deep neural network following the architecture of LPCNet [1].A listening test shows that it significantly improves the perceived quality of bandlimited speech. The system has an algorithmic delay of 30 ms and can be applied in state-of-the-art speech and audio codecs.},

Although various single-channel speech enhancement algorithms based on deep learning have been recently developed, since it is optimized for reducing the mean square error, it can not accurately estimate the actual target values in a regression task, resulting in muffled enhanced speech. Therefore, this paper proposes the DNN classification-based single-channel speech enhancement algorithm to overcome disadvantages of the existing DNN regression-based speech enhancement algorithms. To replace the DNN regression task into the classification task, gain mask templates are predefined using k-means clustering among the gain masks. The input feature vector extracted from the microphone input signal is fed into the DNN’s input and then an optimal gain mask is selected from the gain mask templates. Furthermore, we define the gain mask templates for each noise environment using the DNN-based noise classification to cover various noise environments and use an ensemble structure based on a probability of the noise classification stage.},

  abstract = {We propose a semi-supervised method for enhancing and suppressing self-produced speech recorded with wearable air- and body-conductive microphones. Body-conducted signals are robust against external noise and predominantly contain self-produced speech. As a result, these signals provide informative acoustical clues when estimating a linear filter to separate a mixed signal into self-produced speech and background noise. In a previous study, we proposed a blind source separation method for handling air- and body-conducted signals as a multi-channel signal. While our previously proposed method demonstrated the superior performance that can be achieved by using air- and body-conducted signals in comparison to using only air-conducted signals, the enhanced and suppressed air-conducted signals tended to be contaminated with the acoustical characteristics of the body-conducted signals due to the nonlinear relationship between these signals. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a new source model which takes into consideration the correspondence between these signals and incorporates them within a semi-supervised framework. Our experimental results reveal that this new method alleviates the negative effects of using the acoustical characteristics of the body-conducted signals, outperforming our previously proposed method, as well as conventional methods, under a semi-supervised condition.},

A DNN is optimized, its memory requirement is calculated, and its performance is evaluated using the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric.

  abstract = {This paper presents a distributed adaptive algorithm for node-specific sound zoning in a wireless acoustic sensor and actuator network (WASAN), based on a network-wide acoustic contrast control (ACC) method. The goal of the ACC method is to simultaneously create node-specific zones with high signal power (bright zones) while minimizing power leakage in other node-specific zones (dark zones). To obtain this, a network-wide objective involving the acoustic coupling between all the loudspeakers and microphones in the WASAN is proposed where the optimal solution is based on a centralized generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD). To allow for distributed processing, a gradient based GEVD algorithm is first proposed that minimizes the same objective. This algorithm can then be modified to allow for a fully distributed implementation, involving in-network summations and simple local processing. The algorithm is referred to as the distributed adaptive gradient based ACC algorithm (DAGACC). The proposed algorithm outperforms the non-cooperative distributed solution after only a few iterations and converges to the centralized solution, as illustrated by computer simulations.},

All at the expense of higher computational complexity. In the neural-network based image compression literature, various methods to model the dependencies in the transform domain/latent space are proposed. This work uses an alternative method to exploit the dependencies of the latent representation. The joint density of the latent representation is modeled as a product of conditional densities, which are learned using neural networks. However, each latent variable is not conditioned on all previous latent variables as in the chain rule of factoring joint distributions, but only on a few previous variables, in particular the left, upper and upperleft spatial neighbor variables based on a Markov property assumption for a simpler model and algorthm. The compression performance is comparable with the state- of-the-art compression models, while the conditional densities require a much simpler network and training time due to their simplicity and less number of parameters then its counterparts.},

This paper targets improving image compression efficiency by designing and optimizing an image coding framework where a standard image codec, e.g. JPEG, is combined with deep neural network based pre- and post-processing. While the pre-processing CNN targets simplifying the image to make it more amenable to compression, notably involving its down-sampling, the post-processing CNN targets enhancing the decoded image, also involving its up-sampling. To optimize the compression performance, the processing CNNs are trained involving a third CNN, so-called CNN-FakeCodec, which targets modeling the image codec output, since the encoder-decoder pair is not differentiable, thus not allowing any training. Since the available alternative coding solutions focus on minimizing the image distortion, this paper proposes a new loss function which also considers a rate component, thus allowing to jointly minimize the rate and distortion. The performance results show that the proposed coding solutions can outperform the selected benchmarks, both classical and CNN-based.},

  abstract = {Compressing piecewise smooth images is important for many data types such as depth maps in 3D videos or optic flow fields for motion compensation. Specialised codecs that rely on explicitly stored segmentations excel in this task since they preserve discontinuities between smooth regions. However, current approaches rely on ad hoc segmentations that lack a clean interpretation in terms of energy minimisation. As a remedy, we derive a generic region merging algorithm from the Mumford- Shah cartoon model. It adapts the segmentation to arbitrary reconstruction operators for the segment content. In spite of its conceptual simplicity, our framework can outperform previous segment-based compression methods as well as BPG by up to 3 dB.},

  abstract = {Rapid technological advances and the increasing use of social media has caused a tremendous increase in the generation of digital data, a fact that imposes nowadays a great challenge for the field of digital data storage due to the shortterm reliability of conventional storage devices. Hard disks, flash, tape or even optical storage have a durability of 5 to 20 years while running data centers also require huge amounts of energy. An alternative to hard drives is the use of DNA, which is life's information-storage material, as a means of digital data storage. Recent works have proven that storing digital data into DNA is not only feasible but also very promising as the DNA's biological properties allow the storage of a great amount of information into an extraordinary small volume for centuries or even longer with no loss of information. In this work we present an extended end-to-end storage workflow specifically designed for the efficient storage of images onto synthetic DNA. This workflow uses a new encoding algorithm which serves the needs of image compression while also being robust to the biological errors which may corrupt the encoding.},

  pages = {521-525},
  abstract = {In recent years, the research community started to explore new strategies for encoding image and video content based on innovative coding solutions developed using machine learning (ML) tools. An emerging research strategy proposes novel hybrid coding solutions as an alternative to traditional coding paradigms by replacing specific coding modules with efficient deep-learning (DL) based techniques. The paper presents a study on DL-based intra-prediction methods for lossless compression applications. For image coding, the paper studies our recently proposed pixel-wise prediction methods designed based on the residual learning concept, integrated into conventional lossless image coding frameworks. Moreover, a novel neural network design is proposed based on a new structure of layers. For video coding, the paper studies our recently proposed block-wise prediction methods designed based on recent breakthroughs in the ML domain, and integrated in the lossless HEVC standard. Experimental results show that the proposed lossless image codec achieves an improved performance with 1.6% compared to state- of-the-art DL-based methods. The study reveals that the hybrid coding solutions which incorporate DL-based prediction methods systematically and substantially improve the coding performance over traditional lossless coding paradigms.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1-4},
  abstract = {Video coding standards such as H.264/AVC, HEVC, VVC, etc., all employ intra prediction where a directional prediction uses a single prediction direction inside a coding block. The underlying idea is that the object directionalities remain unchanged over the entire coding block. This is a simplistic model as the object directionalities over a block can change, especially if the block size is relatively large. In such a case, using a single prediction direction over a coding block will lead to smaller coding blocks after rate-distortion (R-D) optimization with side information for partitioning into smaller blocks. A better idea would be to allow the prediction direction to change gradually over the same coding block such that objects with slow changing directionalities can be modelled in larger blocks without splitting them. This would demand additional complexity and the side information required for model parameters. This paper proposes a general framework which supports this change of prediction direction inside a block and presents practical solutions for low complexity implementations. Simulation results with VVC test model (VTM 4) software show Luma BD-rate gain of 0.11% in All Intra (AI) configuration.},

ESA360 performs early SKIP mode selection based on block position and homogeneity to avoid testing the remaining modes and reduce the encoder complexity. The algorithm is developed based on an analysis of the specific behavior of SKIP mode occurrences throughout the video frame when coding equirectangular projected (ERP) 360 videos. This analysis pointed out that due to ERP distortion, the homogeneity of the blocks and the region being coded poses a more significant influence in the selection of SKIP mode for ERP 360 videos when compared to conventional videos. Experimental results show that ESA360 is able to achieve up to 21.44% of complexity reduction with negligible coding efficiency loss, and it is competitive with related works.},

To accelerate this complex partitioning process, this paper proposes a method that halts the usual rate-distortion optimization employed in Coding Unit size decision by a set of decision tree classifiers, which are trained on the fly according to the current video sequence characteristics. The classifiers are built during the encoding process by the C5 machine learning algorithm, which was chosen based on an extensive analysis that compared several algorithms in terms of decision accuracy and training complexity. Experimental results show that the strategy is capable of building accurate models and decreases the HEVC encoding time in 34.4% on average, at the cost of a compression efficiency loss of only 0.2%.},

In particular, intra block copy is well known to accurately predict screen content and artificially generated content where patterns and edges may repeat within the frame. On the other hand, such type of video content is often subject to geometrical transformations such as transitions, rotations, zooms etc, which may not be accurately captured by simply copying neighbouring pixels. A new intra-prediction scheme is presented in this paper whereby blocks of samples from already reconstructed areas are processed by means of an affine-type transformation. This allows more accurate prediction of blocks which improve compression efficiency in a variety of conditions. Experiments in the context of Versatile Video Coding standard show the proposed method can improve intra-coding compression efficiency by 2.01% BD-rates on average, and up to 4.81%, with negligible impact on the decoder complexity.},

The reuse of VP9 block partitioning is proposed based on a statiscal analysis that shows the relation of block parititioning sizes between VP9 and AV1. The analysis demontrates that there is a high probability of the AV1 encoding process to choose block sizes of the same size as in the VP9 encoding.

The network is shallow but dense, so it is fast and accurate. Two additional contributions - a non-linear adjustment of the depth resolution and the introduction of a projection loss, lead to reduction of estimation error by up to 20% and 25% respectively. The results show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average improvement in accuracy of depth estimation and view synthesis by approximately 45% and 34% respectively.

  abstract = {The availability of 3D range scanners and RGB-D cameras is pushing the spreading of point cloud-based applications. One of the main issues of this technology, in applications where the end user is a human observer, is the presentation of the data. Three-dimensional visual information represented as point clouds can be displayed in several ways, e.g. as sets of points with varying point size or as a surface rendered using one of several available methods, such as Poisson surface interpolation. Furthermore, to increase the feeling of presence, or immersiveness, novel hardware can be used such as 3D displays and head mounted devices. However, even if 3D-able visualization devices are available, common users are more accustomed to observing visual information displayed on a 2D screen and it is not clear which combination of presentation method and device are preferred by the users. In this contribution we assess the user preference of visualization of point clouds in terms of different rendering devices and methods. A set of subjective experiments is performed, involving point clouds presented as points or rendered surfaces displayed in 2D and 3D displays. The results obtained were analysed to measure user preferences.},

The proposed algorithm represents the basis for package recognition for automatic trailer loading/unloading. The main focus of this paper is designing a semantic segmentation CNN model capable of detecting different types of package edges in a distance map containing distance errors characteristic of Time-of-Flight (ToF) scanning, and differentiating box edges from edges belonging to other types of packaging objects (bags, irregular objects, etc.). The proposed CNN is optimized for training with a limited number of samples containing heavily imbalanced classes. Generating a binary mask of edges with 1-pixel thickness from the probability maps outputted from the CNN is achieved through a custom non-maximum suppression-based edge thinning algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows promising results in detecting box edges.},

  pages = {605-609},
  abstract = {Scene flow is a three-dimensional (3D) vector field with velocity in the depth direction and optical flow that represents the apparent motion, which can be estimated from RGB-D videos. Scene flow can be used to estimate the 3D motion of objects with a camera; thus, it is used for obstacle detection and self-localization. It can potentially be applied to inter prediction in 3D video coding. The scene-flow estimation method based on the variational method requires numerical computations of nonlinear equations that control the regularization strength to prevent excessive smoothing due to scene-flow regularization. Because numerical stability depends on multi-channel images and computational parameters such as regularization weights, it is difficult to determine appropriate parameters that satisfy the stability requirements. Therefore, we propose a numerical computation method to derive a numerical stability condition that does not depend on the color of the image or the weight of the regularization term. This simplifies the traditional method and facilitates the setting up of various regularization weight functions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

The approach is based on a 2D multicomponent amplitude modulation (AM)-frequency modulation (FM) image modeling, where the 2D monocomponent parts are obtained by sparse approximations that are solved with matching pursuits. For synthetic images, a separable dictionary is built, while a patch-based dictionary learning method is adopted for real images. In fact, the total variation (TV) norm is applied on patches to select the decomposition modes with highest TV-norm, doing so yields to an interesting image analysis tool that properly separates the image frequency contents. The proposed approach turns out to share the same behaviors with the well known empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Obtained results are encouraging for feature and texture analysis, and for image denoising as well.},

In this work, we proposed an automatic segmentation model unique to segment human selfies photos.

We then applied cyclical learning rate method and pre-trained encoder network to fine tune our models. Finally, our best model tested on Google images demonstrated satisfying promising results on both accuracy scores and losses, which will be the precondition in real-time segmentation.

With the development of recent technologies, such as Kinect sensor, new opportunities have emerged in the field of human computer interaction and sign language, allowing to capture both RGB and Depth (RGB-D) information. In the regard to feature extraction, the traditional methods process the RGB and Depth images independently. In this paper, we propose a robust static finger-spelling sign language recognition system adopting the Quaternion algebra that provide a more robust and holistical representation, based on fusing RGB images and Depth information simultaneously. Indeed, we propose, for the first time, a new sets of Quaternion Krawtchouk moments(QKMs) and Explicit Quaternion Krawtchouk Moment Invariants (EQKMIs). The proposed system is evaluated on three well-known finger-spelling datasets, demonstrate the performance of the novel method compared to other methods used in the literature, against geometrical distortion, noisy conditions and complex background, indicating that it could be highly effective for many other computer vision applications.},

A modified Unet-like convolutional neural network (CNN), incorporating dilatation techniques using atrous convolution, is designed to segment cluttered objects in the SEM image. The dense CRF is tailored to enhance object boundaries and recover small objects. The unary energy of the CRF is obtained from the CNN. And the pairwise energy is estimated using mean field approximation. The resulting segmented regions are fed to a fully connected CNN that performs instance recognition. The method has been trained on a dataset of 500 images with 3200 objects from 3 classes. Testing achieves an overall accuracy of 95.7% MOF recognition. The proposed method opens up the possibility for developing automated chemical process monitoring that allows researchers to optimize conditions of MOF synthesis.},

In order to improve the results, recent methods perform these two processes simultaneously and use GAN for the training. However, since these methods do not try to maintain the luminance of non-shadowed regions, the output images tend to be faded. In this paper, to overcome fading problem, we proposed a new GAN structure based on shadow model. Since our GAN-based method focus on the variation of the illuminance, the illuminances of the shadowed regions, whose amount of change are large, are effectively estimated. In addition, non-shadowed regions remain slightly faded due to our new GAN structure and training method. Owing to our novel GAN structure and training method, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM.},

In Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), the most common brightness quantification metrics are the Average Picture Level (APL) and the Frame Average Luminance Level (FALL).

However, they fail to sufficiently characterize the High Dynamic Range (HDR) broader luminance range and larger color volume.

In the proposed CL algorithm for face recognition, we divide the training set of face images into subsets of increasing difficulty based on the head pose angle obtained from the absolute sum of yaw, pitch and roll angles. These subsets are introduced to the deep CNN in order of increasing difficulty. Experimental results on the large-scale CASIA-WebFace-Sub dataset show that the increase in face recognition accuracy is statistically significant when CL is used, as compared to organizing the training data in random batches.},

Although many existing methods have tackled these challenges, they suffer from overfitting, over-smoothing, and unnatural hue change. To solve these problems, we propose a GAN-based de-raining method. The optimal generator is determined by experimental comparisons. To train the generator, we learn the mapping between rainy and residual images from the training dataset. Besides, we synthesize a variety of rainy images to train our network. In particular, we focus on not only the orientations and scales of rain streaks but also the rainy image composite models.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are a very powerful tool for many computer vision tasks, including image restoration, exhibiting state-of-the-art results. However, the performance of deep learning methods tends to drop once the observation model used in training mismatches the one in test time. In addition, most deep learning methods require vast amounts of training data, which are not accessible in many applications. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose to combine two image restoration approaches: (i) Deep Image Prior (DIP), which trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch in test time using the given degraded image. It does not require any training data and builds on the implicit prior imposed by the CNN architecture; and (ii) a backprojection (BP) fidelity term, which is an alternative to the standard least squares loss that is usually used in previous DIP works. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, termed BP-DIP, on the deblurring task and show its advantages over the plain DIP, with both higher PSNR values and better inference run-time.},

A three-step approach is performed to minimise discontinuities across neighbouring patches and to maximise the information captured from different types of micro-lens. Firstly, the useful patch size of each micro-image is determined to limit the contribution of low light intensity regions into the rendered images. Secondly, anisotropic inpainting is applied to smooth the discontinuities between neighbouring patches. Thirdly, a multi-focus image fusion algorithm is used to efficiently combine the information captured by the different types of micro-lens comprising plenoptic cameras with extended depth-of-field. Significant improvements are obtained in the rendered views, by reducing visible discontinuities between adjacent micro-images, while at the same time increasing the average sharpness of image content by 20%, measured by the Energy of Laplacian (i.e., a focus metric), in comparison to the conventional rendering approach, which always selects the best focused lens type.},

An image formation model for hazy images is commonly used to restore both underwater images and hazy images because of the similarity between the two types of images. However, red light is attenuated faster than blue and green light in underwater, and underwater images are distorted by changes of color tone. Therefore, most current methods are specialized for either hazy images or underwater images.

  year = {2020},
  pages = {690-694},
  abstract = {Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches have been able to generate convincing talking heads. Personalization of such talking heads requires training of the model with a large number of examples of the target person. This is also time consuming. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning based few-shot approach for generating personalized 2D talking heads where the lip animation is driven by a given audio. The idea is that the model is meta-trained with a dataset consisting of a large variety of subjects’ ethnicity and vocabulary. We show that our meta-trained model is then capable of generating realistic animation for previously unseen face and unseen audio when finetuned with only a few-shot examples for a very short time (180 seconds). Considering the fact that facial expressions driven by audio are mainly expressed through motion around lips, we restrict ourselves to animating lip only. We have done the experiments on two publicly available datasets: GRID and TCD-TIMIT and our own captured data of Asian people. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis show that animations generated by such meta-learned model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of realism and time taken.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {695-699},
  abstract = {Digital image correlation is a popular method for estimating object displacement in successive images. At the pixel level, displacement is estimated by maximizing the cross-correlation between two images. To achieve subpixel accuracy, displacement estimation can be refined in the vicinity of the cross-correlation peak. Among existing refinement methods, quadratic surface fitting provides a good trade-off between accuracy and computational burden. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the quadratic surface fitting method. It is shown that the quadratic surface fitted to the cross-correlation values in the vicinity of the cross-correlation peak does not always have a maximum. Then the conditions ensuring the existence of a maximum are analyzed. The reported results consolidate the theoretic basis of the quadratic surface fitting method for subpixel motion extraction.},

Our model employs a deformable attention module to align the features calculated at the previous time step with the ones in the current step and then uses a gated operation to combine them. This allows our model to effectively reuse previously calculated features and exploit longer temporal relationships between frames without the need of explicit motion compensation. The experimental validation shows that our approach outperforms current VSR learning based models in terms of perceptual quality and temporal consistency.},

  pages = {710-714},
  abstract = {The low-rank tensor recovery is a powerful approach to depict the intrinsic structure within high-dimensional data, and has been extensively leveraged in many real-world applications. Conventional techniques of low-rank recovery formulate it as a rank minimization problem, then approximate the rank function with the convex relaxation. In this paper, we propose a new tensor logarithmic norm as the nonconvex rank surrogate. Compared with the convex surrogate of nuclear norm, the proposed logarithmic norm is proved to be a tighter approximation to the tensor average rank, and thus is more sparsity-encouraging to extract the underlying low-rank information. Although minimizing the logarithmic norm leads to a nonconvex optimization problem, we rigorously derive its closed-form solution with the guarantee of local optimality. Experimental results demonstrate the strong convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. In the real-world application of video recovery, our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and shows the remarkable recovery accuracy.},

  abstract = {With the fast development of cloud computing, exchanging JPEG compressed images in a secure way has significantly increased. Data hiding in encrypted images (DHEI) is an effective way to embed additional data directly into the encrypted domain. In recent state-of-the-art methods, almost all DHEI processes focused on uncompressed images. Recently, some schemes using data hiding (DH) in JPEG crypto-compressed images have been designed, but most of them are not fully JPEG format compliant. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical high capacity data hiding (HHCDH) approach for JPEG crypto-compressed images. After encrypting every non-null coefficients, they are processed from low to high frequencies. Sign bits that are specific to them are then substituted by bits of a secret message. During the decoding phase, correlations between neighboring blocks are exploited to hierarchically recover the original sign bit values. According to our experiments, we achieve to obtain a high payload value, while preserving a very good quality of the reconstructed JPEG image.},

This approach uses computationally efficient inverse scattering models to recover 3D phase volumes of weakly scattering objects from intensity measurements taken under diverse illumination at a single focal plane. IDT is easily implemented in a standard microscope equipped with an LED array source and requires no exogenous contrast agents, making the technology widely accessible for biological research.Here, we discuss model and learning-based approaches for complex 3D object recovery with IDT. We present two model-based computational illumination strategies, multiplexed IDT (mIDT) [1] and annular IDT (aIDT) [2], that achieve high-throughput quantitative 3D object phase recovery at hardware-limited 4Hz and 10Hz volume rates, respectively. We illustrate these techniques on living epithelial buccal cells and Caenorhabditis elegans worms. For strong scattering object recovery with IDT, we present an uncertainty quantification framework for assessing the reliability of deep learning-based phase recovery methods [3]. This framework provides per-pixel evaluation of a neural network predictions confidence level, allowing for efficient and reliable complex object recovery. This uncertainty learning framework is widely applicable for reliable deep learning-based biomedical imaging techniques and shows significant potential for IDT.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel approach to calibrate a microscope. Instead of seeking a single linear integral operator (e.g. a convolution with a point spread function) that describes its action, we propose to describe it as a low-dimensional linear subspace of operators. By doing so, we are able to capture its variations with respect to multiple factors such as changes of temperatures and refraction indexes, tilts of optical elements or different states of spatial light modulator. While richer than usual, this description however suffers from a serious limitation: it cannot be used directly to solve the typical inverse problems arising in computational imaging. As a second contribution, we therefore design an original algorithm to identify the operator from the image of a few isolated spikes. This can be achieved experimentally by adding fluorescent micro-beads around the sample. We demonstrate the potential of the approach on a challenging deblurring problem.Important note: this paper is an abridged version of a preprint [3] by the same authors, submitted for a journal publication.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Modulo Radon Transform (MRT) which is complemented by an inversion algorithm. The MRT generalizes the conventional Radon Transform and is obtained via computing modulo of the line integral of a two-dimensional function at a given angle. Since the modulo operation has an aliasing effect on the range of a function, the recorded MRT sinograms are always bounded, thus avoiding information loss arising from saturation or clipping effects. This paves a new pathway for imaging applications such as high dynamic range tomography, a topic that is in its early stages of development. By capitalizing on the recent results on Unlimited Sensing architecture, we prove that the Modulo Radon Transform can be inverted when the resultant (discrete/continuous) measurements map to a band-limited function. Thus, the MRT leads to new possibilities for both conceptualization of inversion algorithms as well as development of new hardware, for instance, for single-shot high dynamic range tomography.},

Recent progress has revealed that measurement- and computational-complexity challenges can be alleviated if the underlying signal belongs to certain low-dimensional model families, including sparsity, low-rank, or neural generative models. However, the remaining bottleneck in most of these approaches is the requirement of a carefully chosen initial signal estimate. In this paper, we assume that a portion of the signal is already known a priori as {"}side information{"} (this assumption is natural in applications such as holographic coherent diffraction imaging). When such side information is available, we show that a much simpler initialization can provably succeed with considerably reduced costs.

  year = {2020},
  pages = {780-783},
  abstract = {Multimodal alias, guided, image super-resolution (SR) refers to the reconstruction of a high-resolution (HR) version of a low-resolution (LR) image with the aid of an HR image from another image modality. Common approaches for the SR problem include analytical methods which are computationally expensive. Deep learning methods are capable of learning a nonlinear mapping between LR and HR images from data, delivering high reconstruction accuracy at a low-computational cost during inference; however, these methods do not incorporate any prior knowledge about the problem, with the neural network model behaving like a black box. In this paper, we formulate multimodal image SR as a coupled convolutional sparse coding problem. To solve the corresponding minimization problem, we adopt the Method of Multipliers (MM). We then design a convolutional neural network (CNN) that unfolds the obtained MM algorithm. The proposed CNN accepts as input the LR image from the main modality and the HR image from the guidance modality to reconstruct the desired HR image. Unlike existing deep learning methods, our CNN provides an efficient and structured way to fuse information at different stages of the network and achieves high reconstruction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model for the super-resolution of multi-spectral images guided by their high resolution RGB counterparts.},

  pages = {790-794},
  abstract = {In the context of deep learning, the availability of large amounts of training data can play a critical role in a model’s performance. Recently, several models for audio classification have been pre-trained in a supervised or self-supervised fashion on large datasets to learn complex feature representations, socalled embeddings. These embeddings can then be extracted from smaller datasets and used to train subsequent classifiers. In the field of audio event detection (AED) for example, classifiers using these features have achieved high accuracy without the need of additional domain knowledge. This paper evaluates three state-of-the-art embeddings on six audio classification tasks from the fields of music information retrieval and industrial sound analysis. The embeddings are systematically evaluated by analyzing the influence on classification accuracy of classifier architecture, fusion methods for file-wise predictions, amount of training data, and initial training domain of the embeddings. To better understand the impact of the pre-training step, results are also compared with those acquired with models trained from scratch. On average, the OpenL3 embeddings performed best with a linear SVM classifier. For a reduced amount of training examples, OpenL3 outperforms the initial baseline.},

  abstract = {Obtaining labeled data for machine listening applications is expensive because labeling audio data requires humans listening to recordings. However, state-of-the-art deep learning based systems usually require large amounts of labeled data to be trained with. A solution for this problem is to train a neural network with a large collection of unlabeled data to extract embeddings and then use these embeddings to train a shallow classifier on a small but labeled dataset suitable for the application. One example are Look, Listen, and Learn (L3-Net) embeddings, which are trained self-supervised to capture audio-visual correspondence in videos. Since shallow classifiers are trained discriminatively and thus tacitly assume a closed-set classification task, they do not perform well in open-set classification tasks. In this paper, a neural network that combines all L3-Net embeddings belonging to one recording into a single vector by using an x-vector mechanism as well as an open-set classification system based on that are presented. In experiments conducted on the open-set acoustic scene classification task belonging to the DCASE challenge 2019, the proposed system significantly outperforms a shallow discriminative classifier and all other previously published systems, while at the same time performing equally well as a shallow classifier on multiple closed-set machine listening datasets.},

Frequency-domain MASS algorithms such as multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization achieve better separation quality. However, they require a considerable computational cost for estimating the frequency-wise separation filter. To solve this problem, we propose a new framework combining the MASS algorithms and a simple deep neural network (DNN). In the proposed framework, frequency-domain MASS is performed only in narrowband frequency bins. Then, DNN predicts the separated source components in other frequency bins, where both the observed mixture of all frequency bins and the separated narrowband source components are used as DNN inputs.

In this work, we address the issue of sample drop detection in the context of a conversational speech scenario, recorded by a set of microphones distributed in space. The goal is to design a neural-based model that given a short window in the time domain, detects whether one or more devices have been subjected to a sample drop event. The candidate time windows are selected from a set of large time intervals, possibly including a sample drop, and by using a preprocessing step. The latter is based on the application of normalized cross-correlation between signals acquired by different devices. The architecture of the neural network relies on a CNN-LSTM encoder, followed by multi-head attention. The experiments are conducted using both artificial and real data. Our proposed approach obtained F1 score of 88% on an evaluation set extracted from the CHiME-5 corpus. A comparable performance was found in a larger set of experiments conducted on a set of multi-channel artificial scenes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of several approaches to convolutional feature extraction in the context of deep neural network (DNN) based sound source localization. Different ways of processing multichannel audio data in the time-frequency domain using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are described and tested with the aim to provide a comparative study of their performance. In most considered approaches, models are trained with phase and magnitude components of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In addition to state-of-the-art 2D convolutional layers, we investigate several solutions for the processing of 3D matrices containing multichannel complex representation of the microphone signals. The first two proposed approaches are the 3D convolutions and depthwise separable convolutions in which two types of filters are used to exploit information within and between the channels. Note that this paper presents the first application of depthwise separable convolutions in a task of sound source localization. The third approach is based on complex-valued neural networks which allows for performing convolutions directly on complex signal representations. Experiments are conducted using two synthetic datasets containing noise and speech signals recorded using a tetrahedral microphone array. The paper presents the results obtained using all investigated model types and discusses the resulting accuracy and computational complexity in DNN-based source localization.},

While today’s models are able to achieve considerable age estimation accuracy, their behaviour, especially with respect to specific demographic groups is still not well understood. In this paper, we take a deeper look at CNN-based age estimation models and analyze their performance across different race and gender groups. We use two publicly available off-the-shelf age estimation models, i.e., FaceNet and WideResNet, for our study and analyze their performance on the UTKFace and APPA-REAL datasets. We partition face images into sub-groups based on race, gender and combinations of race and gender. We then compare age estimation results and find that there are noticeable differences in performance across demographics. Specifically, our results show that age estimation accuracy is consistently higher for men than for women, while race does not appear to have consistent effects on the tested models across different test datasets.},

To effectively perform change-point detection in multitemporal images, it is important to devise techniques that are computationally efficient for processing large datasets, and that do not require knowledge about the nature of the changes. In this paper, we introduce a novel online framework for detecting changes in multitemporal remote sensing images. Acting on neighboring spectra as adjacent vertices in a graph, this algorithm focuses on anomalies concurrently activating groups of vertices corresponding to compact, well-connected and spectrally homogeneous image regions. It fully benefits from recent advances in graph signal processing to exploit the characteristics of the data that lie on irregular supports. Moreover, the graph is estimated directly from the images using superpixel decomposition algorithms. The learning algorithm is scalable in the sense that it is efficient and spatially distributed.

This paper proposes an overparametrized graph-aware NN architecture able to represent a non-linear mapping between two graph signals, each defined on a different graph. The considered architecture is based on two NNs and a common latent space. Specifically, we consider an overparametrized graph-aware NN encoder which maps the input graph signal to a latent space, followed by an overparametrized graph-aware NN decoder that transforms the latent representation to the output graph signal. The parameters of the two NNs are jointly tuned by applying the back-propagation algorithm with an early stopping procedure to prevent overfitting. The overall architecture can be interpreted as an overparametrized graph-aware encoder/decoder NN operating over two different graphs. A key element in the encoder (decoding) scheme is the consideration of a nested collection of parametric graph-aware (down-) up-sampling operators, whose design will be studied in detail. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed scheme outperforms the corresponding benchmark NN architectures, previously introduced in the literature.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used effectively in different applications involving the processing of signals on irregular structures modeled by graphs. Relying on the use of shift-invariant graph filters, GNNs extend the operation of convolution to graphs. However, the operations of pooling and sampling are still not clearly defined and the approaches proposed in the literature either modify the graph structure in a way that does not preserve its spectral properties, or require defining a policy for selecting which nodes to keep. In this work, we propose a new strategy for pooling and sampling on GNNs using graphons which preserves the spectral properties of the graph. To do so, we consider the graph layers in a GNN as elements of a sequence of graphs that converge to a graphon. In this way we have no ambiguity in the node labeling when mapping signals from one layer to the other and a spectral representation that is consistent throughout the layers. We evaluate this strategy in a synthetic and a real-world numerical experiment where we show that graphon pooling GNNs are less prone to overfitting and improve upon other pooling techniques, especially when the dimensionality reduction ratios between layers is large.},

Our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology, and effect memory and computational savings by processing the data on-the-fly as they are acquired. The setup entails observations modeled as stationary graph signals generated by local diffusion dynamics on the unknown network. Moreover, we may have a priori information on the presence or absence of a few edges as in the link prediction problem. The stationarity assumption implies that the observations’ covariance matrix and the so-called graph shift operator (GSO – a matrix encoding the graph topology) commute under mild requirements. This motivates formulating the topology inference task as an inverse problem, whereby one searches for a (e.g., sparse) GSO that is structurally admissible and approximately commutes with the observations’ empirical covariance matrix. For streaming data said covariance can be updated recursively, and we show online proximal gradient iterations can be brought to bear to efficiently track the time-varying solution of the inverse problem with quantifiable guarantees. Specifically, we derive conditions under which the GSO recovery cost is strongly convex and use this property to prove that the online algorithm converges to within a neighborhood of the optimal time-varying batch solution. Preliminary numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph learning approach in adapting to streaming information and tracking changes in the sought dynamic network.},

  pages = {870-874},
  abstract = {This paper describes a semi-supervised multichannel speech separation method that uses clean speech signals with frame-wise phonetic labels and sample-level speaker labels for pre-training. A standard approach to statistical source separation is to formulate a probabilistic model of multichannel mixture spectrograms that combines source models representing the time-frequency characteristics of sources with spatial models representing the covariance structure between channels. For speech separation and enhancement, deep generative models with latent variables have successfully been used as source models. The parameters of such a speech model can be trained beforehand from clean speech signals with a variational autoencoder (VAE) or its conditional variant (CVAE) that takes speaker labels as auxiliary inputs. Because human speech is characterized by both phonetic features and speaker identities, we propose a probabilistic model that combines a phone- and speaker-aware deep speech model with a full-rank spatial model. Our speech model is trained with a CVAE taking both phone and speaker labels as conditions. Given speech mixtures, the spatial covariance matrices, latent variables of sources, and phone and speaker labels of sources are jointly estimated. Comparative experimental results showed that the performance of speech separation can be improved by explicitly considering phonetic features and/or speaker identities.},

  abstract = {A desired acoustic source can very often only be observed in a mixture together with interfering sources in a real-life scenario. Hence, extracting the desired signal with a minimum amount of information about the geometric and acoustic setup is a problem of great interest. Recently, methods for blind source extraction based on Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) have been proposed. These algorithms are entirely blind, which prevents them from focussing on a specific source in the mixture. In this contribution, we guide the convergence of the extraction filter by a free-field prior within a Bayesian model towards the desired solution and use recently proposed update rules relying on the Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) for its optimization. The superiority of the presented update rules over a recently proposed state-of-the-art method is shown in experiments using measured Room Impulse Responses (RIRs).},

In our proposed method, we define such interference as an acoustic object. Although the sampling frequencies of the recording and the available acoustic object might be mismatched, we compensate the mismatch and remove the acoustic object from the recording by maximum likelihood estimation using the auxiliary function technique.

An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as well as a multiplicative update (MU) algorithm are known to optimize the FCA model parameters. In this paper, we first investigate the behaviors of both algorithms. We observed that the MU algorithm minimizes the FCA objective function faster than the EM algorithm, but the separation performance at the converged point is better by the EM algorithm than the MU algorithm. We found that the MU algorithm tends to push the covariance matrices towards rank deficient. To mitigate this tendency, we propose a modified FCA model where the tempo-ral parameters are shared within a time block. Experimental results show that the modified model provides better separation performance not only by the MU algorithm but also by the EM algorithm.},

MNMF employs full-rank spatial covariance matrices and can simulate situations in which the reverberation is strong and the sources are not point sources. In conventional MNMF, spectrograms of observed signals are assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In this paper, first, to extend the MNMF model, we introduce the multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution as the multivariate sub-Gaussian distribution. Since the cost function of MNMF based on this multivariate sub-Gaussian model is difficult to minimize, we additionally introduce the joint-diagonalizability constraint in spatial covariance matrices to MNMF similarly to FastMNMF, and transform the cost function to the form to which we can apply the auxiliary functions to derive the valid parameter update rules. Finally, from blind source separation experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods in source-separation accuracy.},

  abstract = {A data-driven approach for multiple speakers localization in reverberant enclosures is presented. The approach combines semi-supervised learning on multiple manifolds with unsupervised maximum likelihood estimation. The relative transfer functions (RTFs) are used in both stages of the proposed algorithm as feature vectors, which are known to be related to source positions. The microphone positions are not known. In the training stage, a nonlinear, manifold-based, mapping between RTFs and source locations is inferred using single-speaker utterances. The inference procedure utilizes two RTF datasets: A small set of RTFs with their associated position labels; and a large set of unlabelled RTFs. This mapping is used to generate a dense grid of localized sources that serve as the centroids of a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) model, used in the test stage of the algorithm to cluster RTFs extracted from multiple-speakers utterances. Clustering is applied by applying the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that relies on the sparsity and intermittency of the speech signals. A preliminary experimental study, with either two or three overlapping speakers in various reverberation levels, demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves high localization accuracy compared to a baseline method using a simpler propagation model.},

Results showed that clusters of recurrence can be identified from body surface recordings in these patients.

  abstract = {Atrial electrograms are often used to gain under-standing on the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Using such electrograms, cardiologists can reconstruct how the de-polarization wave-front propagates across the atrium. Knowing the exact moment at which the depolarization wavefront in the tissue reaches each electrode is an important aspect of such reconstruction. A common way to determine the LAT is based on the steepest deflection (SD) of the individual electrograms. However, the SD annotates each electrogram individually and is expected to be more prone to errors compared to approaches that would employ the data from the surrounding electrodes to estimate the LAT. As electrograms from neighboring electrodes tend to have rather similar morphology up to a delay, we propose in this paper to use the cross-correlation to find the pair-wise relative delays between electrograms. Instead of only using the direct neighbors we consider the array as a graph and involve higher order neighbors as well. Using a least-squares method, the absolute LATs can then be estimated from the calculated pair-wise relative delays. Simulated and clinically recorded elec-trograms are used to evaluate the proposed approach. From the simulated data it follows that the proposed approach outperforms the SD approach.},

The noninvasive extraction of the atrial activity (AA) from multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings by signal processing techniques has helped in better understanding this complex arrhythmia. In particular, tensor decomposition techniques have proven to be powerful tools in this task, overcoming the limitations of matrix factorization methods. Exploring the spatial as well as the temporal diversity of ECG recordings, this contribution puts forward a novel noninvasive AA extraction method that models consecutive AF ECG segments as a coupled block-term tensor decomposition, assuming that they share the same spatial signatures.

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most spread heart arrhythmia, whose mechanisms are not completely clear yet. Catheter ablation is a standard treatment, which isolates the area involved in the arrhythmia. Intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) are used to better understand the AF mechanisms and to find appropriate ablation sites. Bipolar EGMs (b-EGMs) are often employed, but their amplitude and shape depend on catheter orientation, lim-iting reliability. To avoid this uncertainty, an approach insensitive to catheter orientation, referred as Omnipolar EGM (OP-EGM) method, has been introduced, which uses an estimation of the electric field within a group of electrodes, referred as clique. In this work, we compare different mapping approaches based on b-EGMs and OP-EGM signals in simulation including fibrosis, so to evaluate their ability to detect fibrosis and reproduce the spatial distribution of the voltage. Maps have been computed using two clique configurations (square and triangular), introducing or not a previous time alignment of the b-EGMs. OP-EGM signals have been obtained by projecting the electric field along directions of its maximal excursion and its principal components. Results show that the proposed alignment of b-EGMs improves maps based on OP-EGM signals. Both cliques configurations present good performance, in terms of fibrosis detection and correlation with the reference voltage maps.},

We propose a modified measure of mutual information to reflect the degree of simultaneous activation and concurrency in neural firing patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to both correlations and anti-correlations, and it is normalized to attain a fixed bounded index which makes it interpretable. Finally, the measure is compared with widely used indexes of spike train correlation. The estimate of all measures is carried out in controlled experiments with synthetic Poisson spike trains and their corresponding surrogate datasets to asses its statistical significance.},

  abstract = {Granger causality (GC) is a method for determining whether and how two time series exert causal influences one over the other. As it is easy to implement through vector autoregressive (VAR) models and can be generalized to the multivariate case, GC has spread in many different areas of research such as neuroscience and network physiology. In its basic formulation, the computation of GC involves two different regressions, taking respectively into account the whole past history of the investigated multivariate time series (full model) and the past of all time series except the putatively causal time series (restricted model). However, the restricted model cannot be represented through a finite order VAR process and, when few data samples are available or the number of time series is very high, the estimation of GC exhibits a strong reduction in accuracy. To mitigate these problems, improved estimation strategies have been recently implemented, including state space (SS) models and partial conditioning (PC) approaches.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in new field of Network Physiology is how organ systems in the human body dynamically interact to coordinate and synchronize their functions, and integrate as a network to generate distinct states and behaviours at the organism level. Physiological systems exhibit complex dynamics, operate at different time scales, and are regulated by multi-component mechanisms, which poses challenges to studying physiologic coupling and network interactions. We present a method based on the concept of time delay stability to probe transient physiologic network interactions in a group of healthy subjects during sleep. We investigate the multi-layer network structure and dynamics of interactions among (i) physiologically relevant brain rhythms within and across cortical locations, (ii) brain rhythms and key peripheral organ systems, and (iii) organ systems with each other. We demonstrate that each physiologic state (sleep stage) is characterized by a specific network structure and link strength distribution, and that the entire physiological network undergoes hierarchical reorganization across layers with transition from one stage to another. Our findings are consistent across subjects, and indicate a robust association of network structure and dynamics with physiologic state and function. The presented approach provides a new framework to explore physiologic states through networks of organ interactions.},

For this reason, we propose a reformulation of the cluster observation model on Lie groups to intrinsically capture its shape.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient algorithmic framework building onto Alternating Optimization (AO) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for coupled matrix and tensor factorizations incorporating a variety of constraints and coupling with linear transformations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate, computationally efficient with comparable or better performance than available CMTF methods while being also more flexible.},

It is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming problem whose solution gives the first moments of a measure supporting the optimal points. However, extracting the global solutions to the polynomial problem from those moments is still difficult, especially if the latter are poorly estimated. In this paper, we address the issue of extracting optimal points and interpret it as a tensor decomposition problem. By leveraging tools developed for noisy tensor decomposition, we propose a method to find the global solutions to a polynomial optimization problem from a noisy estimation of the solution of its corresponding moment problem. Finally, the interest of tensor decomposition methods for global polynomial optimization is shown through a detailed case study.},

The LaRGE method uses the multi-linear singular values obtained from the HOSVD of the measurement tensor to construct global eigenvalues.

Particularly, our interest lies in latent components that are nonnegative and sum-to-one. This problem is motivated by applications such as hyperspectral unmixing under nonlinear distortion effects. Many prior works tackled nonlinear mixture analysis using statistical independence among the latent components, which is not applicable in our case. A recent work by Yang et al. put forth a solution for this problem leveraging functional equations. However, the identifiability conditions derived there are somewhat restrictive. The associated implementation also has difficulties—the function approximator used in their work may not be able to represent general nonlinear distortions and the formulated constrained neural network optimization problem may be challenging to handle. In this work, we advance both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem of interest. On the theory side, we offer a new identifiability condition that circumvents a series of stringent assumptions in Yang et al.’s work. On the algorithm side, we propose an easy-to-implement unconstrained neural network-based algorithm—without sacrificing function approximation capabilities. Numerical experiments are employed to support our design.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1015-1019},
  abstract = {Hyperspectral images are used for ground-cover classification because many materials can be identified by their spectral signature, even in images with low spatial resolution. Pixels in such an image are often modeled as a convex combination of vectors, called endmembers, that correspond to the reflectance of a material to different wavelengths of light. This is the so-called linear mixing model. Since reflectance is inherently nonnegative, the task of unmixing hyperspectral pixels can be posed as a low-rank nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem, where the data matrix is decomposed into the product of the estimated endmembers and their abundances in the scene. The standard NMF problem then minimizes the residual of the decomposition. Thus, using NMF works well when materials are present in similar amounts, but if some materials are under-represented, they may be missed with this formulation. Alternatively, we propose a novel hyperspectral unmixing model using a collection of NMF subproblems solved for patches of the original image. The endmembers are estimated jointly, such that the the maximum residual across all patches is minimized. In this paper we estimate the solution to the patch-based minimax NMF model, and show that it can estimate rare endmembers with superior accuracy.},

Inspired by the effectiveness and efficiency of Gauss-Newton (GN) for unconstrained CPD, we derive a proximal, semismooth GN type algorithm for non-negative tensor factorization. Global convergence to local minima is achieved via backtracking on the forward-backward envelope function. If the algorithm converges to a global optimum, we show that Q-quadratic rates are obtained in the exact case. Such fast rates are verified experimentally, and we illustrate that using the GN step significantly reduces number of (expensive) gradient computations compared to proximal gradient descent.},

  abstract = {Tensor representations have proven useful for many problems, including data completion. A promising application for tensor completion is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that has an inherent four-dimensional (4D) structure and is prone to missing voxels and regions due to issues in acquisition. A key component of successful tensor completion is a rank estimation. While widely used as a convex relaxation of the tensor rank, tensor nuclear norm (TNN) imposes strong low-rank constraints on all tensor modes to be simultaneously low-rank and often leads to suboptimal solutions. We propose a novel tensor completion model in tensor train (TT) format with a proximal conjugate subgradient (PCS-TT) method for solving the nonconvex rank minimization problem by using properties of Moreau's decomposition. PCS-TT allows the use of a wide range of robust estimators and can be used for data completion and sparse signal recovery problems. We present experimental results for data completion in fMRI, where PCS-TT demonstrates significant improvements compared with competing methods. In addition, we present results that demonstrate the advantages of considering the 4D structure of the fMRI data. as opposed to using three- and two-dimensional representations that have dominated the work on fMRI analysis.},

  abstract = {Due to its high computational speed and accuracy compared to ab-initio quantum chemistry and forcefield modeling, the prediction of molecular properties using machine learning has received great attention in the fields of materials design and drug discovery. A main ingredient required for machine learning is a training dataset consisting of molecular features—for example fingerprint bits, chemical descriptors, etc. that adequately characterize the corresponding molecules. However, choosing features for any application is highly non-trivial, since no {"}universal{"} method for feature selection exists. In this work, we propose a data fusion framework that uses Independent Vector Analysis to uncover underlying complementary information contained in different molecular featurization methods. Our approach takes an arbitrary number of individual feature vectors and generates a low dimensional set of features—molecular signatures—that can be used for the prediction of molecular properties and for knowledge discovery. We demonstrate this on a small and diverse dataset consisting of energetic compounds for the prediction of several energetic properties as well as for demonstrating how to provide insights onto the relationships between molecular structures and properties.},

  pages = {1035-1039},
  abstract = {This paper deals with algorithms for positive semidefinite matrix factorization (PSDMF). PSDMF is a recently-proposed extension of nonnegative matrix factorization with applications in combinatorial optimization, among others. In this paper, we focus on improving the local convergence of an alternating block gradient (ABC) method for PSDMF in a noise-free setting by replacing the quadratic objective function with the Poisson log-likelihood. This idea is based on truncated Wirtinger flow (TWF), a phase retrieval (PR) method that trims outliers in the gradient and thus regularizes it. Our motivation is a recent result linking PR with PSDMF. Our numerical experiments validate that the numerical benefits of TWF may carry over to PSDMF despite the more challenging setting, when initialized within its region of convergence. We then extend TWF from PR to affine rank minimization (ARM), and show that although the outliers are no longer an issue in the ARM setting, PSDMF with the new objective function may still achieves a smaller error for the same number of iterations. In a broader view, our results indicate that a proper choice of objective function may enhance convergence of matrix (or tensor) factorization methods.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most widespread methods for studying the functionality of the brain. Even at rest, the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal reflects systematic fluctuations in the regional brain activity that are attributed to the existence of resting-state brain networks. In many studies, it is assumed that these networks have a common spatially non-overlapping manifestation across subjects, defining a common brain parcellation. In this work, we propose an fMRI data generating model that captures the existence of the common brain parcellation and present a procedure for its estimation. At first, we employ generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (gCCA) - a well-known statistical method, which can be used for the estimation of a common linear subspace - and recover the subspace that is associated with the common brain parcellation. Then, we obtain an estimate of the common whole-brain parcellation map by solving a semi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (s-ONMF) problem. We test our theoretical results using both synthetic and real-world fMRI data. Our experimental findings corroborate our theoretical results, rendering our approach a very competitive candidate for multi-subject resting-state whole-brain parcellation.},

To date, apart from the exact solution to Lp-PCA (p ≤ 1), there exists no converging algorithm of lower cost that approximates its exact solution. In this work, we (i) propose a novel and converging algorithm that approximates the exact solution to Lp-PCA with significantly lower computational cost than that of the exact solver, (ii) conduct formal complexity and convergence analyses, and (iii) propose a multi-component solver based on subspace-deflation. Numerical studies on matrix reconstruction and medical-data classification illustrate the outlier resistance of Lp-PCA.},

  pages = {1050-1054},
  abstract = {Graph filters are at the core of network information processing architectures, with applications in machine learning and distributed collaborative systems. Yet, designing filters for very large graphs is challenging because filter design techniques do not always scale with graph size. We overcome this by using graphons, which are infinite-dimensional representations of graphs that are at once random graph models and limit objects of sequences of graphs. Explicitly, we define graphon filters and leverage convergence properties of graph sequences and spectral properties of both graphs and graphons to show that graph filters converge to graphon filters. Filters designed on a graphon can therefore be applied to finite graphs sampled from it with guaranteed convergence properties. We illustrate our findings in two experiments, which corroborate filter response convergence and illustrate transferability of graph filters even in graphs that are not related to one another through a graphon, but that are built from the same type of data.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the brain play a vital role in the detection of epileptic seizures. This paper proposes a new spectrogram-based deep learning method for the detection and anticipation of epileptic seizures. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method formulates the feature descriptor such that it retains the neighborhood order of spectrograms both in time and frequency, while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the feature descriptor. The spectrogram in each of the 18 EEG channels is constructed by dividing each EEG signal into 3 time-blocks and 19 frequency-blocks. The mean magnitude value of each of these blocks is computed and thereby compactly representing the input EEG signal by a 3D tensor of size 18×19×3. This tensor descriptor is given as an input to the proposed convolution neural network for learning high-level features. Evaluations are performed on a publicly available EEG dataset of 23 patients and the results from the proposed method are compared with 9 other existing methods. Further, a five-class classification is performed using the proposed method for the anticipation of seizures. The proposed method is found to outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods both in detection and anticipation of epileptic seizures.},

In this paper, a new technique that was introduced to solve problems of fluid dynamics called Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), is used to classify seizure and non-seizure epileptic EEG signals. The DMD decomposes a given signal into the intrinsic oscillations called modes which are used to define a DMD spectrum. In the proposed approach, the DMD spectrum is obtained by applying either multi-channel or single-channel based DMD technique. Then, subband and total power features extracted from the DMD spectrum and various classifiers are utilized to classify seizure and non-seizure epileptic EEG segments. Outstanding classification results are achieved by both the single-channel based (96.7%), and the multi-channel based (96%) DMD approaches.},

  pages = {1075-1079},
  abstract = {ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals based Brain Source Localization (BSL) has been an active area of research. The performance of BSL algorithms is severely degraded in the presence of background interferences. Pre-Whitening (PW) based approach to deal with such interference assumes temporal stationarity of the data which does not hold good for EEG based processing. Null Projection (NP) based approach relaxes the temporal stationarity. However, the strict spatial stationarity of the number of interfering sources is maintained between control state and activity state measurement. In practical scenarios where an interference source that exists only in the control state, and does not appear in activity state, NP based approach removes a higher dimension space from the activity data leading to its poor performance. The proposed Subspace Principal Vector Projection (SPVP) based approach utilizes subspace correlation based common interference statistics and thus relaxing the strict spatial stationarity condition. In particular, SPVP based MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) algorithms are presented for BSL. Simulation and experiment with real EEG data from Physionet dataset involving motor imagery task illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in robust BSL with interference suppression.},

The method relies on similarities in the state space and on exploiting the concept of attractor manifolds. The proposed approach was tested on a short segment of real FHR recordings.

The second model combines several classical features with LSTM in order to effectively recognize abnormal classes. These deep learning models are trained using a bagging model then aggregated by a fusion classifier to form a robust unified model.

Automatic sleep scoring is crucial and urgent to help address the increasing unmet need for sleep research.

The proposed model adopts two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN) to automatically learn features from multi-modality signals, together with a {"}squeeze and excitation{"} block for recalibrating channel-wise feature responses. The learnt representations are finally fed to a softmax classifier to generate predictions for each sleep stage. The model performance is evaluated on two public sleep datasets (SHHS and Sleep-EDF) with different available channels. The results have shown that our model achieves an overall accuracy of 85.2% on the SHHS dataset and an accuracy of 85% on the Sleep-EDF dataset. We have also demonstrated that the proposed architecture not only is able to handle various numbers of input channels and several signal modalities from different datasets but also exhibits short runtimes and low computational cost.},

  abstract = {As the fields of brain-computer interaction and digital monitoring of mental health are rapidly evolving, there is an increasing demand to improve the signal processing module of such systems. Specifically, the employment of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is among the best non-invasive modalities for collecting brain signals. However, in practice, the quality of the recorded EEG signals is often deteriorated by impulsive noise, which hinders the accuracy of any decision-making process. Previous methods for denoising EEG signals primarily rely on second order statistics for the additive noise, which is not a valid assumption when operating in impulsive environments. To alleviate this issue, this work proposes a new method for suppressing the effects of heavy-tailed noise in EEG recordings. To this end, the spatio-temporal interdependence between the electrodes is first modelled by means of graph representations. Then, the family of alpha-stable models is employed to fit the distribution of the noisy graph signals and design an appropriate adjacency matrix. The denoised signals are obtained by solving iteratively a regularized optimization problem based on fractional lower-order moments. Experimental evaluation with real data reveals the improved denoising performance of our algorithm against well-established techniques.},

  abstract = {One way to solve under-determined image decomposition is to use statistical information about the type of data to be decomposed. This information can be obtained by a deep learning where convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a subset recently used widely in image processing. In this paper, we have designed a two-stage CNN that takes cytology images of overlapped cervical cells and attempts to separate the cell images. In the first stage, we designed a CNN to segment overlapping cells. In the second stage, we designed a CNN that uses this segmentation and the original image to separate the regions. We implemented a CNN similar to U-Net for image segmentation and implemented a new network for the image separation. To train and test the proposed networks, we simulated 50000 cervical cell cytology images by overlaying individual images of real cervical cells using the Beer-Lambert law. Of these 50000 images, we used 49000 images for training and evaluated the method with 1000 test images. Results on these synthetic images give more than 97% segmentation accuracy and gives decomposition SSIM scores of more than 0.99 and PSNR score of more than 30 dB. Despite these positive results, the permutation problem that commonly effects signal separation occasionally occurred resulting in some cell structure mis-separation (for example, one cell given two nucleoli and the other given none). In addition, when the segmentation was poor from the first stage, the resulting separation was poor.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose an algorithm for estimating vocal tract para sagittal slices in order to have a better overview of the behaviour of the articulators during speech production. The first step is to align the consonant-vowel (CV) data of the sagittal plains between them for the train speaker. Sets of transformations that connect the midsagittal frames with the neighbouring ones is acquired for the train speaker. Another set of transformations is calculated which transforms the midsagittal frames of the train speaker to the corresponding midsagittal frames of the test speaker and is used to adapt to the test speaker domain the previously computed sets of transformations. The newly adapted transformations are applied to the midsagittal frames of the test speaker in order to estimate the neighbouring sagittal frames. Several mono speaker models are combined to produce the final frame estimation. To evaluate the results, image cross-correlation between the original and the estimated frames was used. Results show good agreement between the original and the estimated frames.},

  pages = {1120-1124},
  abstract = {Efficient classification of manifold-based data demands dimensionality reduction. However, the optimal lower dimension is mostly unknown. Also, supervised classification demands a collection of expert-annotated samples. This collection is tedious, costly, and error prone. Thus, semi-supervised classifications are motivated. In this paper, we propose a principled method to determine the optimal lower dimension and to reduce dimension of manifold-based data for their semi-supervised classification. This method relies on a manifold-based random walker graph and enhances the discriminative power of the classifier in the reduced dimensional space. The reduced dimensional data can be classified by any method or the same graph after adapting edge weights of the graph to them. Thus, the proposed dimensionality reduction is independent of the classifier type. This method is evaluated on segmenting tissues on fat-water (2-channel) magnetic resonance images.},

  abstract = {Gliomas are the most frequently occurring primary brain tumors. Determination of the IDH-mutation (Isocitrate De-Hydrogenase) in these tumors improves classification and predicts survival. Currently, the only way of determining the mutation status is through a brain biopsy, which is an invasive procedure. This paper concerns the classification of a brain tumor's mutation status through medical imaging. This study proposes a method based on shape description and machine learning. Magnetic resonance images of brain tumors were manually segmented through contour drawing, then analyzed through mathematical shape description. The extracted features were classified using multiple algorithms of which Random Undersampling Boosted Trees gave the highest accuracy. An accuracy of 86.4% was found using leave-one-out cross-validation on a data set of 13 IDH-positive and 9 IDH-wild-type gliomas. The results indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach, but further research on a larger data set is required.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems based on Steady-State motion-Visual Evoked Potentials (SSmVEP), where motion stimulation is utilized to address high brightness and uncomfortably issues associated with conventional light-flashing/flickering. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classification model that extracts features of the SSmVEPs directly from the videos of stimuli. More specifically, the proposed deep architecture, referred to as the Deep Video Canonical Correlation Analysis (DvCCA), consists of a Video Feature Extractor (VFE) layer that uses characteristics of videos utilized for SSmVEP stimulation to fit the template EEG signals of each individual, independently. The proposed VFE layer extracts features that are more correlated with the stimulation video signal as such eliminates problems, typically, associated with deep networks such as overfitting and lack of availability of sufficient training data. The proposed DvCCA is evaluated based on a real EEG dataset and the results corroborate its superiority against recently proposed state-of-the-art deep models.},

  abstract = {Cardiopulmonary monitoring involves surveilling the important physiological parameters of an individual like the breathing rate (BR) and the heart rate (HR). This paper uses a simple, off-the-shelf dual multifrequency Continuous Wave (CW) radar setup to monitor the BR and HR of a static individual. The source separation problem of extracting the HR signal in presence of a higher amplitude BR signal poses a huge challenge and has been effectively solved by using an optimal channel selection process and the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm in this paper. Frequency extraction from the nonstationary signal modes produced by VMD has been performed by using the Fourier-Bessel transform to extract precise frequency information. Results show that the proposed system is accurate and outperforms other existing mode decomposition methods like Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) with a mean absolute error of 5.1±5.4 with respect to the number of heartbeats per minute and an accuracy of 95.87%(±4.9) with respect to the number of breaths per minute.},

  abstract = {Pervasive detection and quantification of tremor for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, using Commercial Off-the-self (COTS) wrist-wearable device is an important problem to investigate. Parkinsonian tremor is one of the earliest and major surrogate biomarker which indicates the progress or status of the disease for patients under treatment using drugs or deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. However, it is a challenging issue as tremor occurs at the minor extremities like fingers in some cases such as pill-rolling symptom, the effect of the same on a wrist-worn motion sensor system is not significant enough to be captured. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) as a novel sensor modality in detecting tremor at rest. Our preliminary results gathered from healthy cohorts performing simulations of Parkinsonian tremor elucidates the merit of the proposed method. Also, since PPG acquisition is power-hungry, we have leveraged a conceptual method of compressive sensing to reduce the overall power requirement of the application.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the heart. Two main types of AF are defined as paroxysmal and persistent. In this paper, we present a method to discriminate between the characteristics of paroxysmal and persistent using tensor decompositions of a multi-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. For this purpose, ECG signals are segmented by applying a Hilbert transform on the thresholded signal. Dynamic time warping is used to align the separated segments of each channel and then a tensor is constructed with three dimensions as time, heartbeats and channels. A Canonical polyadic decomposition with rank 2 is computed from this tensor and the resulting loading vectors describe the characteristics of paroxysmal and persistent AF in these three dimensions. The time loading vector reveals the pattern of a single P wave or abnormal AF patterns. The heartbeat loading vector shows whether the pattern is present or absent in a specific beat. The results can be used to distinguish between the patterns in paroxysmal AF and persistent AF.},

  abstract = {In the automotive industry, it is important to evaluate different car setups in order to match a professional driver's preference or to match the most acceptable setup for most drivers. Therefore, it is of great significance to devise objective and automatic procedures to assess a driver's response to different car settings. In this work, we analyze different physiological signals in order to evaluate how a particular car setup can be more or less stressful than others. In detail, we record an endosomatic Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal, called Skin Potential Response (SPR), the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, and eye tracking coordinates. We eliminate motion artifacts by processing two SPR signals, one from each hand of the driver. Tests are carried out in a company that designs driving simulators, where the tested individuals had to drive along a straight highway with several lane changes. Three different car setups have been tested (neutral, understeering, and oversteering). We apply a statistical test to the data extracted from the cleaned SPR signal, and we then compare the results with the ones obtained using a Machine Learning algorithm. We show that we are able to discriminate the drivers' response to each setup, and, in particular, that the base car setup generates the least intense emotional response when compared to the understeering and the oversteering car setups.},

  abstract = {Current tests to measure whether a person can understand speech require behavioral responses from the person, which is in practice not always possible (e.g. young children). Therefore there is a need for objective measures of speech intelligibility. Recently, it has been shown that speech intelligibility can be measured by letting a person listen to natural speech, recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) and decoding the speech envelope from the EEG signal. Linear decoders are used, which is sub-optimal, as the human brain is a complex non-linear system and cannot easily be modeled by a linear decoder. We therefore propose an approach based on deep learning which can model complex non-linear relationships. Our approach is based on dilated convolutions as used in WaveNet to maximize the receptive field with regard to the number of tunable parameters. Comparison with a model based on a state of the art linear decoder and a convolutional baseline model shows that our proposed model significantly improves on both models (from 62.3% to 90.6% (p<; 0.001) and from 78.8% to 90.6% (p<; 0.001) respectively). Best results are achieved with a receptive field size between 250-500ms, which is longer than the optimal integration window for a linear decoder.},

In this paper, we adopt GSP tools to build features related to the frequency content of the signals. To make these features highly discriminative, we apply an extension of the Fukunaga-Koontz transform. We then use these new features to train a decision tree for the prediction of autism spectrum disorder. Interestingly, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available ABIDE dataset.},

  abstract = {Cry analysis of preterm newborns has proven to be relevant for prediction of pathologies or for comparison with full-term newborns. In this paper we propose a new approach for the automated detection and tracking of the fundamental frequency in cries, based on the processing of the spectrogram. A first step automatically detects the frequency bounds including the fundamental frequency along each cry. Then, the tracking of the fundamental frequency is obtained after a contour detection. Results showed that this new approach allows to process efficiently all types of cries. This whole procedure applied to a database including 1889 cries from 14 babies, at term-equivalent age, highlighted differences between extremely, very and late preterm as well as full-term newborns. In addition, we observed a decrease of the mean fundamental frequency with increasing gestational age, a result in accordance with the literature.},

This paper uses a dataset for imagined speech to classify vowels based on the neurological areas of the brain. The normalized cross-correlation matrices between two electrodes are used as features. We demonstrate that by using the EEG from the frontal region of the brain, we obtain higher than 85 percent accuracy for correct vowel decoding by using two types of neural networks: convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). This accuracy is higher than previous studies that have classified the dataset using the entire brain region. This work shows great promise for task decoding where the physiological regions of the brain associated with specific tasks are exploited. The proposed approach has the potential to be deployed in future BCI applications.},

  pages = {1200-1204},
  abstract = {Cry analysis has been proven to be an inescapable tool to evaluate the development of preterm infants. However, to date, only a few authors proposed to automatically extract spontaneous cry events in the real context of Neonatal Intensive Care Units. In fact, this is challenging since a wide variety of sounds can also occur (e.g., alarms, adult voice). In this communication, a new method for spontaneous cry extraction from real life recordings of long duration is presented. A strategy based on an initial segmentation between silence and sound events, followed by a classification of the resulting audio segments into two classes (cry and non-cry) is proposed. To build the classification model, 198 cry events coming from 21 newborns and 439 non-cry events, representing the richness of the clinical sound environment were annotated. Then, a set of features, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, was computed in order to describe each audio segment. It was obtained after Harmonic plus Noise analysis which is commonly used for speech synthesis although never applied for newborn cry analysis. Finally, six machine learning approaches have been compared. K-Nearest Neighbours approach showed an accuracy of 94.1%. To experience the precision of the retained classifier, 412 hours of recordings of 23 newborns were also automatically processed. Results show that despite a difficult clinical context an automatic extraction of cry is achievable. This supports the idea that a new generation of non-invasive monitoring of neuro-behavioral development of premature newborns could emerge.},

  pages = {1205-1209},
  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most often present in childhood, may persist in adult life, hampering personal development. However, ADHD diagnosis is a real challenge since it highly depends on the clinical observation of the patient, the parental and scholar information, and the specialist expertise. Despite demanded objective diagnosis aids from biosignals, the physiological biomarkers lack robustness and significance under the non-stationary and non-linear electroencephalographic dynamics. Therefore, this work presents a supported diagnosis methodology for ADHD from the dynamic characterization of EEG based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and probability product kernels (PPK). Relying on the impulsivity symptom, the proposed approach trains an HMM for each subject from EEG signals at failing rewarded inhibition tasks. Then, PPK measures the similarity between subjects through the inner product between their trained HMMs. Therefore, a support vector machine supports ADHD diagnosis as a classification task using PPK as the inner product operator. Results in a real EEG dataset evidence that the proposed approach achieves an 90.0% accuracy rate, outperforming log-likelihood features as baseline HMM-based features. Besides, achieving such an accuracy at the highest reward level supports that ADHD patients seem to be particularly sensitive to the reward presence when they execute specific tasks.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological disease that is very common worldwide. In the literature, patient’s electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for an epilepsy diagnosis. However, the success of epileptic examination procedures from quantitative EEG signals is limited. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) is used to classify epileptic EEG signals. The SST matrices of seizure and pre-seizure EEG data of 16 epilepsy patients are calculated. Two approaches based on machine learning and deep learning are proposed to classify pre-seizure and seizure signals. In the machine learning-based approach, the various features like higher-order joint moments are calculated and these features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. In the deep learning-based approach, the SST matrix was recorded as an image and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture was used to classify these images. Simulation results demonstrate that both approaches achieved promising validation accuracy rates. While the maximum (90.2%) validation accuracy is achieved for the machine learning-based approach, (90.3%) validation accuracy is achieved for the deep learning-based approach.},

  abstract = {The human genome, composed of nucleotides, is represented by a long sequence of the letters A,C,G,T. Typically, organisms in the same species have similar genomes that differ by only a few sequences of varying lengths at varying positions. These differences can be observed in the form of regions where letters are inserted, deleted or inverted. These anomalies are known as structural variants (SVs) and are difficult to detect. The standard approach for identifying SVs involves comparing fragments of DNA from the genome of interest and comparing them to a reference genome. This process is usually complicated by errors produced in both the sequencing and mapping process which may result in an increase in false positive detections. In this work we propose two different approaches for reducing the number of false positives. We focus our attention on refining deletions detected by the popular SV tool delly. In particular, we consider the ability of simultaneously considering sequencing data from a parent and a child using a neural network and gradient boosting as a post-processing step. We compare the performance of each method on simulated and real parent-child data and show that including related individuals in training data greatly improves the ability to detect true SVs.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1239-1243},
  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a sustained arrhythmia whose mechanisms are still largely unknown. A recent patient-tailored AF ablation therapy is based on the use of a multipolar mapping catheter called PentaRay. This new protocol targets areas of spatiotemporal dispersion (STD) in the atria as potential AF drivers. However, interventional cardiologists localize STD sites visually through the observation of intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). The present work aims to automatically characterize ablation sites in STD-based ablation. Recent research suggests that the distribution of the time series of maximal voltage absolute values at any of the PentaRay bipoles (VAVp) is affected by the STD pattern. Motivated by this finding, we consider VAVp as a key feature for STD identification. To our knowledge, this work applies for the first time statistical analysis and machine learning (ML) tools to automatically identify STD areas based on VAVp time series. Experiments are first conducted on synthetic data to quantify the effect of STD pattern characteristics (number of delayed leads, fractionation degree and number of fractionated leads) on engineered features of the VAVp time series like kurtosis, showing promising results. Then these features are tested on a real dataset of 23082 multichannel EGM signals from 16 different persistent AF patients. Statistical features like kurtosis and distribution (histogram) of VAVp values are extracted and fed to supervised ML classifiers, but no significant dissimilarity is obtained between the two categories. The classification of raw VAVp time series is finally conducted using ML tools like a shallow convolutional neural network combined with cross validation and data augmentation, reaching AUC values of 96%.},

The pupil size analysis of oscillations due to contraction and dilation could be a useful instrument for diagnosis of disorders related to their own control mechanisms and an index of neurological disease affecting other nerve centres.

  abstract = {Spectral computed tomography acquires energy-resolved data that allows recovery of densities of constituents of an object. This can be achieved by decomposing the measured spectral projection into material projections, and passing these decomposed projections through a tomographic reconstruction algorithm, to get the volumetric mass density of each material. Material decomposition is a nonlinear inverse problem that has been traditionally solved using model-based material decomposition algorithms. However, the forward model is difficult to estimate in real prototypes. Moreover, the traditional regularizers used to stabilized inversions are not fully relevant in the projection domain.In this study, we propose a deep-learning method for material decomposition in the projection domain. We validate our methodology with numerical phantoms of human knees that are created from synchrotron CT scans. We consider four different scans for training, and one for validation. The measurements are corrupted by Poisson noise, assuming that at most 105 photons hit the detector. Compared to a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm, the proposed deep-learning approach provides a compromise between noise and resolution, which reduces the computation time by a factor of 100.},

  abstract = {Denoising algorithms via sparse representation are among the state-of-the art for image restoration. On previous work, we proposed SPADE - a sparse- and prior-based method for 3D-image denoising. In this work, we extend this idea to learning approaches and propose a novel residual-U-Net prior-based (ResPrU-Net) method that exploits a prior image. The proposed ResPrU-Net architecture has two inputs, the noisy image and the prior image, and a residual connection that connects the prior image to the output of the network. We compare ResPrU-Net to U-Net and SPADE on human knee data acquired on a spectral computerized tomography scanner. The prior image is built from the noisy image by combining information from neighbor slices and it is the same for both SPADE and ResPrU-Net. For deep learning approaches, we use four knee samples and data augmentation for training, one knee for validation and two for test. Results show that for high noise, U-Net leads to worst results, with images that are excessively blurred. Prior-based methods, SPADE and ResPrU-Net, outperformed U-Net, leading to restored images that present similar image quality than the target. ResPrU-Net provides slightly better results than SPADE. For low noise, methods present similar results.},

We provide conditions for the robustness of blind calibration in noise. Numerical simulations show that the method becomes more robust for shorter wavelengths, as the transfer function matrices then tend to be less ill-conditioned.

  abstract = {Medical image registration plays an essential role in subsequent image processing and analysis. The demand of direct 3D registration of volumetric image data has been arisen due to the increasing amount of medical image data. This paper investigates a fast volumetric image registration algorithm based on an incompressible viscous fluid model. While direct extension and implementation from 2D fluid registration is inaccessible, we develop numerical techniques to accelerate the computation based on the alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme. In consequence, the computational complexity is significantly reduced from O(N3) to O(N). Not only does the computation time expedite, but the memory usage is also cut down. Massive experiments with both simulated and clinical magnetic resonance (MR) image data were administered to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the proposed 3D image registration framework. Experimental results suggested that our accelerated image registration algorithm produced high accuracy on both 2D and 3D image registration scenarios and outperformed competing methods. We believe that the proposed volumetric image registration scheme is promising in processing MR image volumes for further medical applications.},

Beamforming and channel equalisation techniques are applied to the multi-channel recordings made in the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valve areas. The proposed channel equaliser cancels out the distorting effect of the chest and rib cage on the heart sound frequency spectrum. It is shown that the applied beamforming methods effectively suppress the interfering lung noise and improve the signal to interference and noise ratio by 16 dB. The results confirm the superior performance of the implemented multi-channel stethoscope compared with commercially available single-channel electronic stethoscopes.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly-used method of extracting high resolution retinal information. Moreover there is an increasing demand for the automated retinal layer segmentation which facilitates the retinal disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-prediction guided attention network (MPG-Net) for automated retinal layer segmentation in OCT images. The proposed method consists of two major steps to strengthen the discriminative power of a U-shape Fully convolutional network (FCN) for reliable automated segmentation. Firstly, the feature refinement module which adaptively re-weights the feature channels is exploited in the encoder to capture more informative features and discard information in irrelevant regions. Furthermore, we propose a multi-prediction guided attention mechanism which provides pixel-wise semantic prediction guidance to better recover the segmentation mask at each scale. This mechanism which transforms the deep supervision to supervised attention is able to guide feature aggregation with more semantic information between intermediate layers. Experiments on the publicly available Duke OCT dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as an improved performance over other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  pages = {1304-1308},
  abstract = {Segmentation of retinal blood vessels is important for diagnosis of many retinal diseases. Precise segmentation of complete vessel-map is still a challenge in low contrast regions of fundus images. Vessel pixels belonging to these regions, such as, fine vessel-endings and boundaries of vessels, get merged in the neighboring vessel-like texture. This paper proposes a novel retinal vessel segmentation algorithm which handles the background vessel-like texture in a sophisticated manner without harming the vessel pixels. In this work, first we enhance all possible vessel-like features of fundus at different `levels' using 2-D Gabor wavelet and Gaussian matched filtering. At each `level', texture is suppressed using Local Laplacian filter while preserving the vessel edges. The resulting images are combined to produce a maximum response image with enhanced vessels of different thicknesses and suppressed texture. This handcrafted image is used to train the deep U-net model for further suppression of non-vessel pixels. Proposed segmentation method is tested on publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases. The algorithm has produced state-of-the-art results. It has performed outstandingly well in terms of sensitivity measure which is most affected with the correct segmentation of fine vessels and vessel-boundary pixels present in low-contrast regions.},

This distinctive aspect is exploited to study the topological evolution of time series/signals. Specifically, EEG signals analysis is considered here for the challenging task of cognitive fatigue detection. This work utilizes the topological attributes like Betti numbers, and persistent homology of dimension 0 and 1 extracted from EEG signals to study the cognitive state of an individual. Using the CogBeacon dataset, a comparison of the topological features with the conventional time and frequency domain features is presented. Random forest classifier is used to classify the fatigue state. Results show that the performance of topological features is at par with the conventional features even when significantly less number of topological features are used. Also, enhancement in classification accuracy is observed by appropriately combining both conventional and topological features which outperforms the state-of-the-art method for fatigue detection. Additionally, recursive feature elimination is applied on combined features to reduce redundancy by selecting a subset consisting of prominent features. Analysis indicates that all topological features derived from EEG signals contribute to the best performing subset, which also increases the overall accuracy.},

Detecting SVs is challenging because most approaches suffer from high-false positive rates. In this work, we improve the accuracy of SV detection by exploiting familial relationships and the rare occurence of these rearrangements. Mathematically, we pose SV detection as a constrained optimization problem regularized by a sparsity promoting term. Furthermore, we generalize our previous methods in two ways. First, we consider a biologically realistic scenario of a parent-child-trio, where each individual may carry zero, one, or two copies of any potential SV. Second, we employ a novel block-coordinate descent approach with orthogonal projection to efficiently minimize the objective and to enforce feasibility within the biological constraint space. Numerical results using both simulated and real trios demonstrate that our proposed approach improves our ability to separate true SVs from false positives.},

To create averaged motion sequences, motion sequences of different test persons were originally recorded with a motion capture system (MoCap system) and then averaged using an HMM approach. The resulting averaged data sets, however, partly showed serious motion artifacts and uncoordinated intermediate movements, especially in the extremities. The aim of this work was to combine only movements with similar courses in the extremities by a suitable cluster analysis. For each test person, model body descriptions of 21 body elements are available, each of which is represented in three-dimensional time series. For optimization, the MoCap data are first compared using time warp edit distance (TWED) and clustered using an agglomerative hierarchical procedure. Finally, the data of the resulting clusters are used to generate new averaged motion sequences using the HMM approach. The resulting averaged data can be used, for example, in a simulation in a multilevel biomechanical model.},

  abstract = {Monitoring the progress of patients during the rehabilitation process after an operation is beneficial for adjusting care and medical treatment in order to improve the patient’s quality of life. The supervised methods used for this in the literature need data labeling, which is a time and cost-intensive procedure. In this paper, we propose Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for monitoring the progress of the rehabilitation, utilizing the kinematic data from a Wearable Sensor System (WSS). The WSS provides three-dimensional linear acceleration and angular velocity from multiple body parts such as the lower back and lower limbs during walking at any speed on level ground. Twelve patients with hip unilateral arthroplasty completed two weeks of gait training after the operation. The classification results of different Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placements revealed that the IMU placed at thigh achieved the highest accuracy. The proposed DCNN achieved up to 98% classification accuracy for the rehabilitation progress monitoring. This approach provides an objective and evidence-based way of understanding clinically important changes in human movement patterns in response to exercise therapy.},

  abstract = {Automated detection of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is gaining importance for its application in smart living, elderly car, healthcare, to name a few. In this paper a novel automated method for detection of human activity is proposed using range time scan data of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar. Unlike earlier methods of activity recognition using multi sensor fusion and multi radar setup, we have used a single UWB radar in monostatic mode. In this work, intensity of the reflected UWB signal is used to quantify the amount of scattering leading to formation of range time data matrix. Relevant feature extraction from the range time data via two-dimensional two-directional principal component analysis (2D2D-PCA) is carried out. These features are subsequently used by a random subspace ensemble classifier with k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The proposed method is highly efficient with an average training and testing accuracy of 91.4% and 86.4%, respectively, even on unknown subjects. Moreover the technique resulted in average precision and recall of 0.87 and 0.84, respectively.},

Although biomarkers as TBR and P300 rely on ADHD physiology, differences between ADHD and control lack significance. In this work, we propose a feature extraction approach based on the common spatial patterns (CSP) from EEG signals to support the ADHD diagnosis. Our features quantify the channel-wise discriminative capacity from the resulting spatial patterns and eigenvalues. We validated the proposed methodology using synthetic and real EEG signal. In the former, the proposed index suitably identifies the spatial location of differentiating sources, while attenuates the common activity. In the latter, the resulting subject-wise features fed a linear discriminant analysis as the supported-diagnosis tool. Achieved 87% accuracy rate proves that the discriminative index identifies outperforms conventional biomarkers in the ADHD diagnosis.},

  pages = {1357-1361},
  abstract = {Neural speech decoding aims at direct decoding of speech from the brain to restore speech communication in patients with locked-in syndrome (fully paralyzed but aware). Despite the recent progress, exactly which aspects of neural activities are characterizing the decoding process is still unclear. Neural oscillations have been associated with playing a key functional role in neural information processing and thus might provide significant insight into the decoding process. Previous research has investigated a limited range of neural frequencies for decoding, usually the high-gamma oscillations (70-200Hz) in electrocorticography (ECoG) and lower-frequency waves (1-70Hz) in electroencephalography (EEG). Hence, the exact contribution of specific frequency bands is still unclear. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive method for directly measuring underlying brain activity and has the temporal resolution needed to investigate the role of cortical oscillations in speech decoding, which we attempted in this study. We used three machine learning classifiers (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify different imagined and spoken phrases for finding the role of brainwaves in speech decoding. The experimental results showed a significant contribution of low-frequency Delta oscillations (0.1-4 Hz) in decoding and the best performance was achieved when all the brainwaves were combined.},

  abstract = {Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death among aged population worldwide. To understand the mechanism and damage of cerebral ischemia, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rodents has been generally adopted. For its celerity and veracity, the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining has been widely utilized to visualize the infarct lesion. An important precursor is to segment the brain regions and compute the midline that separates the brain for subsequent processing. This paper develops an automated brain extraction and hemisphere separation framework in TTC-stained rat images captured by a smartphone. A saliency feature detection scheme associated with superpixels is exploited to extract the brain region into individual slices from the compound image. A chain of edge detection, morphological operation, and polynomial regression methods are introduced to compute the midline. Massive experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results indicated that our brain extraction algorithm outperformed competitive methods and our hemisphere separation scheme provided high accuracy.},

Using fractal textures, often seen as relevant models in real-world applications, the present work compares a recently devised texture segmentation algorithm incorporating expert-driven scale-free features estimation into a Joint TV optimization framework against convolutional neural network architectures. From realistic synthetic textures, comparisons are drawn not only for segmentation performance, but also with respect to computational costs, architecture complexities and robustness against departures between training and testing datasets.},

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to learn from training classes with a lot of samples and transform the knowledge to support classes with only a few samples, thus realizing model generalization. In this paper, a novel FSL framework called Attention Relation Network (ARN) is proposed, which introduces channel and spatial attention respectively to learn a more effective feature representation of support samples. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve excellent performance for fine-grained signal modulation recognition even with only one support sample and is robust to low signal-to-noise-ratio conditions.},

Previous studies of detecting OSA are focused on using feature engineering where a specific number of features from ECG signals are selected as an input to the machine learning model. In this study, we focus on detecting OSA from ECG signals where our proposed machine learning methods automatically extract the input as features from ECG signals. We proposed three architectures of deep learning approaches in this study: CNN, CNN with LSTM and CNN with GRU. These architectures utilized consecutive R interval and QRS complex amplitudes as inputs. Thirty-five recordings from PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database have been used to evaluate our models. Experimental results show that our architecture of CNN with LSTM performed best for OSA detection.

  abstract = {Performing fast few-shot learning is increasingly important in a number of embedded applications. Among them, a form of gradient-descent free learning known as Weight Imprinting was recently established as an efficient way to perform few-shot learning on Deep Learning (DL) accelerators that do no support back-propagation, such as Edge Tensor Processing Units (Edge TPUs). Despite its efficiency, WI comes with a number of critical limitations. For example, WI cannot effectively handle multimodal novel categories, while it is especially prone to overfitting that can have devastating effects on the accuracy of the models on novel categorizes. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose a robust hypersphere-based WI approach that allows for regularizing the training process in an imprinting-aware way. At the same time, the proposed formulation provides a natural way to handle multimodal novel categories. Indeed, as demonstrated through the conducted experiments, the proposed method leads to significant improvements over the baseline WI approach.},

In the last years, many methods were developed to visualize important regions of an input image for the decision of the deep neural network. Since almost all methods are designed for supervised trained models, we propose in this work a visualization technique for unsupervised trained autoencoders called Gradient-weighted Latent Activation Mapping (Grad-LAM). We adapt the idea of Grad-CAM and propose a novel weighting based on the knowledge of the autoencoder’s decoder.

Our method can be trained using unsupervised objectives and relies on the denoising auto-encoder model that uses a simple sinusoidal model as decoding functions to reconstruct the singing voice. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we employ the obtained representations to the task of informed singing voice separation via binary masking, and measure the obtained separation quality by means of scale-invariant signal to distortion ratio. Our findings suggest that our method is capable of learning meaningful representations for singing voice separation, while preserving conveniences of the the short-time Fourier transform like non-negativity, smoothness, and reconstruction subject to time-frequency masking, that are desired in audio and music source separation.},

Their main ingredients are a highly non-linear processing, a massive learning made possible by the flourishing of optimization algorithms with the power of computers (GPU) and the use of large available data sets for training. While the many stages of non-linearity are intrinsic to deep learning, the usage of learning with training data could also be exploited by sparsity based approaches. The aim of our study is to push the limits of sparsity with learning, and comparing the results with U-nets. We present a new network architecture, which conserves the properties of sparsity based methods such as exact reconstruction and good generalization properties, while fostering the power of neural networks for learning and fast calculation. We evaluate the model on image denoising tasks and show it is competitive with learning-based models.},

  abstract = {Spatial trajectories are ubiquitous and complex signals. Their analysis is crucial in many research fields, from urban planning to neuroscience. Several approaches have been proposed to cluster trajectories. They rely on hand-crafted features, which struggle to capture the spatio-temporal complexity of the signal, or on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which can be more efficient but less interpretable. In this paper we present a novel ANN architecture designed to capture the spatio-temporal patterns characteristic of a set of trajectories, while taking into account the demographics of the navigators. Hence, our model extracts markers linked to both behaviour and demographics. We propose a composite signal analyser (CompSNN) combining three simple ANN modules. Each of these modules uses different signal representations of the trajectory while remaining interpretable. Our CompSNN performs significantly better than its modules taken in isolation and allows to visualise which parts of the signal were most useful to discriminate the trajectories.},

Unlike existing designs, our approach focuses on modeling the temporal correlation between the sparse representations of consecutive video frames. To this end, we perform the unfolding of an iterative algorithm for solving reweighted ℓ1-ℓ1 minimization; this unfolding leads to a different proximal operator (a.k.a. different activation function) adaptively learned per neuron. Experimentation using the moving MNIST dataset shows that the proposed network outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art RPCA network in the task of video foreground-background separation.},

To improve the prediction accuracy, we propose in this paper a novel GPR algorithm that introduces the estimate of precision matrix of target values.

Since signal models in radar are inherently nonlinear with respect to unknown range, Doppler or angles, and moreover, radar processing is intrinsically stochastic, stochastic NNs which tie the numerical capability of NNs with the probabilistic inferences can enhance model-based radar processing. Indeed, radar data are complex-valued while most algorithms based on NNs are real-valued and furthermore, lack of uncertainty assessment. To address these issues, we elaborate, in the present paper, a stochastic complex-valued NNs framework for radar. We show that these networks can achieve parameter estimation with refined learned models from radar measurements and provide an indicator of the uncertainty on the estimation. We also build a stopping criterion based on the detection principles, so that the NNs training stops when there is noise only in data. Finally, the performances of the networks are illustrated in simulation.},

A simple but promising approach for clustering of multi-view data is multi-view clustering (MVC), which has been developed extensively to classify given subjects into some clustered groups by learning latent common features that are shared across multi-view data. Among existing approaches, graph-based multi-view clustering (GMVC) achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging a shared graph matrix called the unified matrix. However, existing methods including GMVC do not explicitly address inconsistent parts of input graph matrices. Consequently, they are adversely affected by unacceptable clustering performance. To this end, this paper proposes a new GMVC method that incorporates consistent and inconsistent parts lying across multiple views. This proposal is designated as CI-GMVC.

In this paper, we focus on the online setting where data arrives one-by-one or in small batches ordered by tasks and task boundaries are unknown. Avoiding catastrophic forgetting in such a setting is of great interest since it would allow DNNs to accumulate knowledge without the need to store all previously seen data even if task boundaries are unknown.

This work proposes a new tensor co-clustering algorithm that uses a class of Bregman divergences to measure the coherence of co-clusters on an individual mode basis, while ensuring that the interactions of their prototyping elements capture the tensor intra-modal structure. A co-clustering algorithm based on the alternating-direction method of multipliers is developed. The proposed algorithm decouples the co-clustering problem into an iterative two-step process whose steps are reminiscent of classical one-way clustering and Tucker decomposition problems. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical tests.},

  abstract = {Distributed signal processing will play a major role in performing learning and inference tasks in a client-server model proposed in federated learning. Clients (IoT devices) having many signal samples can aid a data-center (server) in learning the global signal model, by pooling these distributed samples. The clients may have privacy concerns, and the pooling of distributed samples will require accounting of communication cost involved. As a result, a processed approximation of these samples may be desirable. This decentralized learning approach is termed as distributed signal analytics in this work. Overpredictive signal approximations may be desired to perform such distributed signal analytics, which are primarily motivated by applications in network demand (capacity) estimation and planning. In this work, we propose algorithms that calculate an overpredictive signal approximation at the client devices using an efficient convex optimization framework. A tradeoff between the number of bits communicated by clients to the server and the signal approximation error is quantified. An analysis of our approximations is presented on an available residential energy consumption dataset.},

The SORN representation is a dual number representation that uses a fixed set of exact values and open intervals. Arithmetic operations in SORN representation can be realized by lookup tables which allows fast and low-complexity computing. This arithmetic is used for the non-support vector filtering in the early stages of a cascade SVM. Once the training subsets passed the bottom layer of the cascade, the optimization on the remaining support vectors can be done in classic representations like floating point or fixed point.},

  abstract = {Under the transportation field, the literature states that forecasting with excessive number of features can be computational inefficient and undertakes the risk of over-fitting. Because of that, several authors proposed the use of autoencoders (AE) as a way of learning fewer but useful features to enhance the road traffic forecast. Notably, the adequacy of the bottleneck layer dimension of the AE has not been addressed, thus there is no standard way for automatic selection of the dimensionality. We address the problem from an information theory perspective as the reconstruction error is not a reliable indicator of the performance of the subsequent supervised learning algorithm. Hence, we propose an algorithm based on how mutual information and entropy of data evolve during training of the AE. We validate it against two real-world traffic datasets and provide discussion why the entropy of codes is a reliable performance indicator. Compared to the tendency found in the literature, based on trial-and-error methods, the advantage of our proposal is that a practitioner can efficiently find said dimension guaranteeing maximal data compression and reliable traffic forecast.},

A low-dimensional state space can then be successfully constructed, where each individual state is a quantized vector encoding representing a cluster of correlated frames of the high-dimensional state space.

The SO-CFAR detector has exceptional good detectional capabilities, however, suffers from a very high false alarm rate and has therefore only been given limited attention in the literature.

  abstract = {Model-free agent in reinforcement learning (RL) generally performs well but inefficient in training process with sparse data. A practical solution is to incorporate a model-based module in model-free agent. State transition can be learned to make desirable prediction of next state based on current state and action at each time step. This paper presents a new learning representation for variational RL by introducing the so-called transition uncertainty critic based on the variational encoder-decoder network where the uncertainty of structured state transition is encoded in a model-based agent. In particular, an action-gating mechanism is carried out to learn and decode the trajectory of actions and state transitions in latent variable space. The transition uncertainty maximizing exploration (TUME) is performed according to the entropy search by using the intrinsic reward based on the uncertainty measure corresponding to different states and actions. A dedicate latent variable model with a penalty using the bias of state-action value is developed. Experiments on Cart Pole and dialogue system show that the proposed TUME considerably performs better than the other exploration methods for reinforcement learning.},

Recently Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) approaches have proven their effectiveness for image colorization tasks. Inspired by GANs methods, we propose a novel colorization model that produces more realistic quality results. The model employs an additional discriminator which works in the feature domain. Using a feature discriminator, our generator produces structural high-frequency features instead of noisy artifacts. To achieve the required level of details in the colorization process, we incorporate non-adversarial losses from recent image style transfer techniques. Besides, the generator architecture follows the general shape of U-Net, to transfer information more effectively between distant layers. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated quantitatively as well as qualitatively with places365 dataset. Results show that the proposed model achieves more realistic colors with less artifacts compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, DNNs need to be scaled down to fit real-word applications where memory and computation resources are limited. As a means to compress the network yet still maintain the performance of the network, knowledge distillation has brought a lot of attention. This technique is based on the idea to train a student network using the provided output of a teacher network. Deploying multiple teacher networks facilitates learning of the student network, however, it causes to some extent waste of resources. In the proposed approach, we generate multiple teacher networks from a teacher network by exploiting stochastic block and skip connection. Thus, they can play the role of multiple teacher networks and provide sufficient knowledge to the student network without additional resources. We observe the improved performance of student network with the proposed approach using several dataset.},

Many solutions have been proposed by relying on statistical or machine learning techniques. However, in most cases, the results are not yet satisfactory. Hence, motivated by the advent of deep learning, different solutions have also been proposed, such as by adopting autoencoders and adversarial training. However, in most of these solutions, the results are impaired by the network structure and training strategy, constraining the accuracy of missing value imputation. In this paper, we revisit autoencoder networks and show that through a careful selection of network structure and optimization strategy we outperform other deep learning solutions.

The first step is to use CNN architecture to compute the feature vector of a given image. The second step is to apply Manifold Learning algorithms on the features computed in the first step to making a refined feature vector. Eventually, this final representation is used to train SVM classifier. In the first step, we adopted VGG-19 network trained from scratch in order to extract texture features. In the next step, we used the DIMAL (Deep Isometric Manifold Learning Using Sparse Geodesic Sampling) configuration to train a neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space in a nonlinear manner for generating the refined feature vector of the input image. Our concept is that the combination of a deep-learning framework with manifold learning techniques has the potential to select discriminative texture features from a high dimensional space. Based on this idea, we adopted this combination to perform nonlinear feature extraction in texture images. The resulting learned features were then used to train SVM classifier. The experiments demonstrated that our approach achieved better accuracy in texture classification than existing models if trained from scratch.},

  abstract = {Photonic-based neuromorphic hardware holds the credentials for providing fast and energy efficient implementations of computationally complex Deep Learning (DL) models. At the same time, the unique nature of neuromorphic photonics also imposes a number of limitations that hinders its application, including the need to re-train DL models in order to be compliant with the underlying hardware architecture, as well as the existence of various noise sources, which are prevalent in virtually all neuromorphic photonic architectures and negatively affect the accuracy of the deployed models. In this paper we propose a novel noise-aware approach for training neural networks realized on photonic hardware, which can alleviate some of these limitations. To this end we first provide an extensive characterization of the various noise sources that affect sigmoid-based recurrent photonic architectures, as well as provide an extensive study on the effect of various signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) levels on the performance of such DL models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a challenging forecasting problem that involves high frequency financial time series using a state-of-the-art recurrent photonic architecture, which natu-rally fits the requirements of such latency-critical applications. Apart from providing more accurate models, the proposed method opens several interesting future research directions on co-designing neuromorphic photonics, including developing DL models that can work on lower SNRs, leading to more energy efficient solutions.},

We use manually selected masks to train two types of neural networks, U-Net and Deeplabv3+, to solve the same semantic segmentation task. We show that neural networks are able to learn from imperfect datasets, artificially generated by other algorithms. Deep convolutional architectures outperform the algorithm based on computer vision techniques. In order to find the best model, a comparison was made between the two architectures, thereby concluding that Deeplabv3+ achieves better results and features robust operation under adverse environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Current efforts to detect electricity theft cyber-attacks in advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) are hindered by the lack of malicious electricity theft datasets. Therefore, anomaly detectors trained with the energy consumption profiles of honest customers appear as a plausible solution to overcome the lack of malicious datasets. Taking into account this constraint, this paper examines the performance of two structures of variational auto-encoders (VAEs); fully-connected (FC) VAE and long-short-term-memory (LSTM) VAE in detecting electricity thefts. The proposed structures are promising and exhibit an improvement of 11 − 15% in detection rate, 9 − 22% in false alarm rate, and 27 − 37% in the highest difference compared to existing state-of-the-art anomaly detectors that are shallow and static, such as single-class support vector machine (SVM) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.},

  abstract = {Having proven their suitability for real world applications, surface electromyography signals are the means of choice for hand gesture recognition especially in medical applications like upper limb prosthesis. So far, mostly hand-crafted features combined with a standard classifier or neural networks are adopted for signal analysis. However, the performance of the standard approaches is insufficient and the networks are inappropriate for embedded applications due to their sheer size. To address these problems, a small recurrent neural network is proposed to fully utilize the sequential nature of the biosignals. Our network architecture features a special recurrent neural network cell for feature learning and extraction instead of convolutional layers and another type of cell for further processing. To evaluate the suitability of this inhomogenously stacked recurrent neural network, experiments on three different databases were conducted. The results reveal that this small network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems and sets new records. In addition, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve relatively equal performance across all subjects.},

One possible application of machine learning is to perform unsupervised anomaly detection. Indeed, among all available data, the anomalies are supposed to be very sparse and the expert might not have the time to label all the data as nominal or not. Many solutions exist to this unsupervised problem, but are known to provide many false alarms, because some scarce nominal modes might not be included in the training dataset and thus will be detected as anomalies. To tackle this issue, we propose to present an existing iterative algorithm, which presents potential anomaly to the expert at each iteration, and compute a new boundary according to this feedback using One Class Support Vector Machine.},

  abstract = {Latent variable model based on variational autoen-coder (VAE) is influential in machine learning for signal processing. VAE basically suffers from the issue of posterior collapse in sequential learning procedure where the variational posterior easily collapses to a prior as standard Gaussian. Latent semantics are then neglected in optimization process. The recurrent decoder therefore generates noninformative or repeated sequence data. To capture sufficient latent semantics from sequence data, this study simultaneously fulfills an amortized regularization for encoder, extends a Gaussian mixture prior for latent variable, and runs a skip connection for decoder. The noise robust prior, learned from the amortized encoder, is likely aware of temporal features. A variational prior based on the amortized mixture density is formulated in implementation of variational recurrent autoencoder for sequence reconstruction and representation. Owing to skip connection, the sequence samples are continuously predicted in decoder with contextual precision at each time step. Experiments on language model and sentiment classification show that the proposed method mitigates the issue of posterior collapse and learns the meaningful latent features to improve the inference and generation for semantic representation.},

This attenuation may limit the capacity of the communication channel and cause irreversible damage. Accurate prediction of the attenuation opens the possibility to take appropriate actions to minimize such damage. In this paper, we present the use of the Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) machine learning method for short term prediction of the attenuation in commercial microwave links (CMLs), where only past measurements of the attenuation in a given link are used to predict future attenuation, with no side information. We demonstrate the operation of the proposed method on real-data signal level measurements of CMLs during rain events in Sweden. Moreover, this method is compared to a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting, the Auto-Regression Moving Average (ARIMA). The results show that learning patterns from previous attenuation values during rain events in a given CML are sufficient for generating accurate attenuation predictions.},

  abstract = {Large-scale MIMO systems offer high spectral efficiency with excellent error performance at low power so long as accurate channel estimates are available. When channel estimation is performed using only pilot signals, undesirably long pilot sequences are needed to achieve the required accuracy. This paper describes an iterative receiver algorithm where detected/decoded data symbols extend the pilot sequences as virtual pilot signals. By using extrinsic feedback, where only information on how the error correction code decoder modifies a posteriori bit probabilities from the detector output is fed back to the channel estimation and detection system, the errors made by the detector and channel estimator do not lead to instability. The proposed system is able to estimate time domain multipath channels with high accuracy. Communications with this system only requires 0.5 dB more power than the system using ideal channel state information, and about 2.5 dB less power than the system that estimates the channel using only the pilot signal. The receiver is also able to operate with coarsely quantized measurements so that low cost receivers can be used at each antenna.},

  abstract = {We propose a compact hardware architecture for measuring sparse channel impulse responses (IR) by extending the M-Sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) measurement principle with the concept of compressed sensing. A channel is excited with a periodic M-sequence and its response signal is observed using a Random Demodulator (RD), which observes pseudo-random linear combinations of the response signal at a rate significantly lower than the measurement bandwidth. The excitation signal and the RD mixing signal are generated from compactly implementable Linear Feedback Shift registers (LFSR) and operated from a common clock. A linear model is derived that allows retrieving an IR from a set of observations using Sparse-Signal-Recovery (SSR). A Matrix-free model implementation is possible due to the choice of synchronous LFSRs as signal generators, resulting in low computational complexity. For validation, real measurement data of a time-variant channel containing multipath components is processed by simulation models of our proposed architecture and the classic M-Sequence method. We show successful IR recovery using our architecture and SSR, outperforming the classic method significantly in terms of IR measurement rate. Compared to the classic method, the proposed architecture allows faster measurements of sparse time-varying channels, resulting in higher Doppler tolerance without increasing hardware or data stream complexity.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is a core technology to realize high-speed data for 5G and beyond systems. Though machine learning-based MIMO detection techniques outperform conventional symbol detection techniques, in large user massive MIMO, they suffer from maintaining an optimal bias-variance trade-off to yield optimal performance from an individual model. Hence, in this article, collaborative learning based low complexity detection technique is proposed for uplink symbol detection in large user massive MIMO systems. The proposed detection technique strategically ensembles multiple fully connected neural network models utilizing iterative meta-predictor and reduces the final estimation error by smoothing the variance associated with individual estimation errors. Simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed detection technique under both perfect and imperfect channel state information scenarios. Simulation results reveal that the proposed detection technique achieves a lower bit error rate while maintaining a low computational complexity as compared to several existing uplink massive MIMO detection techniques.},

  abstract = {The main aim of the Spectrum Sensing (SS) in a Cognitive Radio system is to distinguish between the binary hypotheses H0: Primary User (PU) is absent and H1: PU is active. In this paper, Machine Learning (ML)-based hybrid Spectrum Sensing (SS) scheme is proposed. The scattering of the Test Statistics (TSs) of two detectors is used in the learning and prediction phases. As the SS decision is binary, the proposed scheme requires the learning of only the boundaries of H0-class in order to make a decision on the PU status: active or idle. Thus, a set of data generated under H0 hypothesis is used to train the detection system. Accordingly, unlike the existing ML-based schemes of the literature, no PU statistical parameters are required. In order to discriminate between H0-class and elsewhere, we used a one-class classification approach that is inspired by the Isolation Forest algorithm. Extensive simulations are done in order to investigate the efficiency of such hybrid SS and the impact of the novelty detection model parameters on the detection performance. Indeed, these simulations corroborate the efficiency of the proposed one-class learning of the hybrid SS system.},

  abstract = {To combat the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the inter-block interference (IBI) caused by multi-path fading in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, it is usually recommended employing a cyclic prefix (CP) with length equal to the channel order. In some practical cases, however, the channel order is not exactly known. Looking for a balance between a full-sized CP and its absence, we investigate the redundancy issues and propose a minimum redundancy OFDM receiver using deep-learning (DL) tools. In this way, we can benefit from an improved reception performance, when compared with CP-free case, and also a better spectrum utilization when compared with the CP-OFDM case. Moreover, compared with the CP-free case, improved performance can be obtained even when the channel order is not available. Simulation results indicate that a good BER level can be achieved and the proposed technique can also be applied in other DL-based receivers.},

  abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the key enabling technologies of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) concept. When it comes to BLE-based dynamic indoor tracking, however, due to drastic fluctuations of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), highly acceptable accuracies are not yet achieved. Although very recent introduction of BLE v 5.1 promises prosperous future for BLE-based dynamic tracking, the following two key issues are in the path: (i) Despite of being in the age of big data with huge emphasis on reproducibility of research, there is no unified dataset with precise ground truth available for performing dynamic BLE-based tracking, and; (ii) The main focus of existing works are on utilization of stand-alone models. The paper addresses these gaps. At one hand, we introduce a reliable dataset, referred to as the IoT-TD, leveraging specific set of four optical cameras to provide ground truth with millimeter accuracies. The introduced IoT-TD dataset consists of RSSI values collected from five BLE sensors together with synchronized Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals from the target’s mobile device. On the other hand, the paper introduces a multiple-model dynamic estimation framework coupling RSSI-based particle filtering with IMU-based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). Experimental results based on the IoT-TD dataset corroborate effectiveness of multiple modeling fusion frameworks for providing enhanced BLE-based tracking accuracies.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated different aspects of our modern life where smart sensors enabled with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are deployed increasingly within our surrounding indoor environments. BLE-based localization is, typically, performed based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which suffers from different drawbacks due to its significant fluctuations. In this paper, we focus on a multiplemodel estimation framework for analyzing and addressing effects of orientation of a BLE-enabled device on indoor localization accuracy. The fusion unit of the proposed method would merge orientation estimated by RSSI values and heading estimated by Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to gain higher accuracy in orientation classification. In contrary to existing RSSIbased solutions that use a single path-loss model, the proposed framework consists of eight orientation-matched path loss models coupled with a multi-sensor and data-driven classification model that estimates the orientation of a hand-held device with high accuracy of 99%. By estimating the orientation, we could mitigate the effect of orientation on the RSSI values and consequently improve RSSI-based distance estimates. In particular, the proposed data-driven and multiple-model framework is constructed based on over 10 million RSSI values and IMU sensor data collected via an implemented LBS platform.},

First, acceleration signals are encoded in the time-frequency domain by three different linear transforms. Second, we propose a method to anonymize the acceleration signals by filtering in the time-frequency domain. Finally, we evaluate our approach for the three different linear transforms with a neural network classifier by comparing the performances for activity versus identity recognition. We extensively study the validity of our framework with a reference dataset: results show an accurate activity recognition (85%) while limiting the re-identifation rate (32%). This represents a large utility improvement (19%) against a slight privacy decrease (10%) compared to state-of-the-art baseline.},

In this paper, we develop an ADMM-Net framework for correlated spatio-temporal data recovery. Both the spatial correlation and temporal correlation of sensing data are considered in a convex optimization problem, which is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We then unfold the ADMM algorithm into a fixed-length neural network that reduces the iterations dramatically and does not require additional location information of nodes. Experimental results on a realworld dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve faster convergence speed than the baseline ADMM algorithm with slight accuracy loss.},

However, sensors drift over time due to sensor aging and environmental factors, which makes calibration necessary. In this paper, we propose a hidden Markov model approach for sensor self-calibration, which builds on the physical model of gas sensors based on the Beer-Lambert law. We focus on the statistical dependency between a calibration coefficient and the temperature change. Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to learn the stochastic parameters of the hidden Markov model are derived and numerically tested. The true calibration coefficient at each time instant is estimated using the Viterbi algorithm. The numerical experiments using CO2 sensor data show excellent initial results which confirms that data-driven calibration of non-dispersive infrared gas sensors is possible. Meanwhile, the challenge in the practical design is to find an appropriate quantization scheme to keep the computation burden reasonable while achieving good performance.},

In this manuscript, we propose a novel MAB algorithm called ϵ -UCB in order to enhance the spectrum learning of a SU and decrease the regret, i.e. the loss of reward due to the selection of worst channels. We analytically prove, and corroborate with simulations, that the regret of the proposed algorithm has a logarithmic behavior. So, after a finite number of time slots, the SU can estimate the vacancy probability of channels in order to target the best one for transmitting. Hereinafter, we extend ϵ -UCB to consider multiple priority users, where a SU can selfishly estimate and access the channels according to his prior rank. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm for a single or multi-user cases compared to the well-known MAB algorithms.},

Starting with a generic resource allocation task formulated as a variational program with nonconvex stochastic constraints, we leverage classical results on Gaussian smoothing to formulate a finite dimensional, smoothed problem surrogate, effectively solvable in a model-free fashion, without the need of a baseline system model. Further assuming a near-universal policy parameterization, we present explicit upper and lower bounds on the gap between the optimal value of the original variational problem, and the dual optimal value of the smoothed surrogate. In fact, we show that this duality gap depends linearly on smoothing and near-universality parameters, and therefore, it can be made arbitrarily small at will. Our results effectively quantify the effects of both policy parameterization and smoothing on approximating both the value and optimal solution of the original variational program via surrogate dualization, and provide explicit near-optimality guarantees in the model-free regime. We also provide empirical illustration via indicative numerical simulations.},

This can highly impact the reliability and latency of the vehicular link, which are crucial for safety-related applications. In this paper, we propose applying the framework of grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for a collision resilient V2X communication. Grant-free NOMA allows for uncoordinated transmissions and can resolve collisions by means of specially designed transmit signatures, combined with an advanced receiver that utilizes the structure of those signatures.

  abstract = {We address the problem of resource allocation (RA) in a cognitive radio (CR) communication system with multiple secondary operators sharing spectrum with an incumbent primary operator. The key challenge of the RA problem is the inter-operator coordination arising in the optimization problem so that the aggregated interference at the primary users (PUs) does not exceed the target threshold. While this problem is easily solvable if a centralized unit could access information of all secondary operators, it becomes challenging in a realistic scenario. In this paper, considering a satellite setting, we alleviate this problem by proposing two approaches to reduce the information exchange level among the secondary operators. In the first approach, we formulate an RA scheme based on a partial information sharing method which enables distributed optimization across secondary operators. In the second approach, instead of exchanging secondary users (SUs) information, the operators only exchange their contributions of the interference-level and RA is performed locally across secondary operators. These two approaches, for the first time in this context, provide a trade-off between performance and level of inter-operator information exchange. Through the numerical simulations, we explain this trade-off and illustrate the penalty resulting from partial information exchange.},

In this paper, we consider a single user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and propose a low computational complexity method for designing a switch-based hybrid precoder that maximizes the mutual information. We propose a method wherein the analog beamformer is approximated after solving a convex (concave) problem and employing low-rank matrix decomposition. Then, considering a sequence of channel realizations we frame the intermediate convex problem as an online convex optimization (OCO) and give the conditions under which the online version approaches the solution of the primary convex problem after some iterations by learning from previous steps. We finally study the performance through numerical results and demonstrate that the proposed online method offers a low complexity solution that tracks the spectral efficiency delivered by fully digital beamformer, and converges to the solution provided by direct maximization of the intermediate problem.},

  abstract = {Through recent wireless technologies, such as Centralized Radio Access Network, baseband unit aid remote radio heads are physically separated and connected using fronthaul links. Compressing complex baseband signal samples prior transmission over fronthaul link is an effective Way to satisfy the pressing need to decrease the huge required transported data rates. In this paper, we analyze the easting IQ data compression schemes exploiting time and spectral signal characteristics. We consider compression system evaluation parameters to have a smooth trade-off between required signal quality and complexity performance while achieving an acceptable compression gain. We propose an optimized uniform quantization technique combined with entropy coding achieving non-uniform quantization performance by exploiting signal temporal statistical characteristics with much less computational complexity. We also present a comparison between simulation results analyzing the trade-off between the removal of the signal spectral redundancies and vector quantization in terms of performance and complexity.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1767-1771},
  abstract = {This paper studies the capabilities of a proposed lossy, grouped-bin FFT quantisation compression method for targeting Off-The-Air (OTA) Radio Frequency (RF) signals. The bins within a 512-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are split into groups of adjacent bins, and these groups are each quantised separately. Additional compression can be achieved by setting groups which are not deemed to contain significant information to zero, based on a pre-defined minimum magnitude threshold. In this paper, we propose two alternative methods for quantising the remaining groups. The first of these, Grouped-bin FFT Threshold Quantisation (GFTQ), involves allocating quantisation wordlengths based on several pre-defined magnitude thresholds. The second, Grouped-bin FFT Error Quantisation (GFEQ), involves incrementing the quantisation wordlength for each group until the calculated quantisation error falls below a minimum error threshold. Both algorithms were tested for a variety of signal types, including Digital Private Mobile Radio 446 MHz (dPMR446), which was considered as a case study. While GFTQ allowed for higher Compression Ratios (CR), the compression process resulted in added quantisation noise. The GFEQ algorithm achieved lower CRs, but also lower noise levels across all test signals.},

  abstract = {Frame synchronization is an important functionality that should be supported in the design of an LTE baseband receiver. Detecting the start of a frame is regularly repeated during transmission and to identify the cells of the network. Typically, the synchronization is performed using correlation-based methods that incur a large number of multiplications and thus increase the power consumption and hardware complexity. Approaches to reduce the rate of multiplications come at the expense of reduced performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we present a multiplication-free synchronization algorithm that is based on K-means clustering and distributed arithmetic and uses the primary synchronization signal (PSS). We also show through simulations that the immense improvement in power consumption and hardware complexity does not entail a degradation in performance compared to current synchronization techniques.},

In near-field, both the direction of arrival (DOA) and range are required for the localization. In order to reduce computational burden, a lot of methods perform 1-D estimation procedures based on symmetric array configurations, but with degrees of freedom about the half of the number of sensors. In this paper, we consider the near-field source localization problem with increased degrees of freedom, by using the property of quasi-stationary signals and Khatri-Rao product.

The DOAs are estimated through a one-dimensional search and the ranges are obtained with the estimated DOAs without searching or pairing.

Localization, a critical basis of many applications such as cognitive radio and first response networks, can benefit UAV technology as well. In such scenarios, an underinvestigated problem is the non-collaborative localization of multiple primary users (PUs). Therefore, this work proposes a data-driven multiple PU localization algorithm based on the angular and power measurements performed by a UAV equipped with an antenna array. The measured data firstly generate a score map, then a threshold and a hierarchical clustering method are applied to the score map to both detect the number of PUs and estimate their location. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by numerical results in terms of probability of detecting the number of PUs, and root-mean-square-error of position estimation. The proposed solution exhibit remarkable performance considering that the approach requires only the knowledge of the PUs frequency band.},

In this paper, we consider a sparse array receive beamformer design approach for Multi-Functional Antennas (MFA), operating in different frequency bands. In this approach, antenna positions are selected from uniformly spaced locations that are served by a limited number of transceiver chains. The design objective is to maximize the beamformer output Signal-to-Interference-plus-noise-ratio (MaxSINR) for desired sources with disjoint frequency bands operating in a wideband jamming environment. The problem is solved efficiently through alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and simplified to parallel quadratically constraint quadratic programs (QCQP) with a single associated constraint. The re-weighted group sparsity is adopted to ensure a common sparse configuration across all frequency bands.

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1851-1855},
  abstract = {Generally, the least mean square (LMS) adaptive algorithm is widely used in antenna array beamforming given its target tracking capability and its low computational requirements. However, the classical LMS implementation still suffers from a trade-off between convergence speed and residual error floor. Numerous variants to the classical LMS have been suggested as a solution for the previous problem at the cost of a considerable increase in the computational complexity and degraded performance in low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Thus, in this paper, we propose a multi-stage parallel LMS structure with an error feedback for accelerating the LMS convergence while maintaining a minimal steady state error and a computational complexity of order O(N), where N represents the number of antenna elements. In parallel LMS (pLMS), the second LMS stage (LMS2) error is delayed by one sample and fed-back to combine with that of the first LMS stage (LMS1) to form the total pLMS error. A transfer function approximation to the pLMS is derived in order to numerically assess the pLMS stability and to determine the approximate maximum parametric value of the step size for which the pLMS remains stable. Simulation result highlight the superior performance of the pLMS in demonstrating accelerated convergence and low steady state error compared to previous variants and for different SNR environment.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1861-1865},
  abstract = {In the field of array processing, Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimation of close sources in the presence of modeling errors is a challenging problem. Indeed, the degradation of high-resolution methods on such scenario is well known and documented in the literature. This paper proposes an operational sparse L0-regularized method as an alternative. In sparse DOA estimation methods, the determination of the regularization parameter is a critical point, and it is generally empirically tuned. We first provide, in the presence of modeling errors, a theoretical statistical study to estimate the admissible range for this parameter in the presence of two incoming sources. For close sources, we therefore show that the admissible range is shortened. For an operational system, an off-line predetermination of the regularization parameter is required. We show that its selection is closely connected to the resolution limit for a given modeling error. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed implementation and its superiority in comparison with high-resolution methods.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1866-1870},
  abstract = {Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation is a mature topic with decades of history. Despite the progress in the field, very few papers have looked at the problem of DoA estimation with unknown dynamic range. Consider the case of space exploration or near-field and far-field emitters. In such settings, the amplitude of the impinging wavefront can be much higher than the maximum recordable range of the sensor, resulting in information loss via clipping or sensor saturation. In this paper, we present a novel sensing approach for DoA estimation that exploits hardware-software co-design and is pivoted around the theme of unlimited sensing. On the hardware front, we capitalize on a radically new breed of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which, instead of saturating, produce modulo measurements. On the algorithmic front, we develop a mathematically guaranteed DoA estimation technique which is non-iterative and backwards compatible with existing DoA algorithms. Our computer experiments show the efficiency of our approach by estimating DoAs from signals which are orders of magnitude higher than the ADC threshold. Hence, our work paves a new path for inverse problems linked with DoA estimation and at the same time provides guidelines for new hardware development.},

  pages = {1871-1875},
  abstract = {The detection and localization of multiple targets is a fundamental research area for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. In many civilian applications of MIMO technology, for example, automotive radar, high resolution direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is required. In this paper, a novel DOA estimation algorithm based on tensor decomposition is proposed for collocated transmit beamspace MIMO radar. First, we introduce the flipped-conjugate version of the transmit beamspace matrix, which focuses the transmit energy into fixed region. This can increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of targets. Then we reshape the received data into a tensor form, the structure of which provides the estimations of the transmit and receive steering matrices. The alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm is applied to find the tensor components. The DOA estimation is conducted in transmitters via the rotational invariance property achieved by beamspace matrix. It is proved that at most M−2 grating lobes exist during the process of DOA estimation, where M is the number of the transmitters. These grating lobes can be eliminated by finite trials of spectrum search. The performance of our proposed DOA estimation method surpasses several conventional algorithms in terms of accuracy and resolution.},

  pages = {1876-1880},
  abstract = {This paper aims at developing low-complexity solutions for super-resolution two-dimensional (2D) harmonic retrieval via covariance reconstruction. Given the collected sample covariance, a novel gridless compressed sensing approach is designed based on the atomic norm minimization (ANM) technique. The key is to perform a redundancy reduction (RR) transformation that effectively reduces the large problem size at hand, without loss of useful frequency information. For uncorrelated sources, the transformed 2D covariance matrices in the RR domain retain a salient structure, which permits a sparse representation over a matrix-form atom set with decoupled 1D frequency components. Accordingly, the decoupled ANM (DANM) framework can be applied for super-resolution 2D frequency estimation, at low computational complexity on the same order of the 1D case. An analysis of the complexity reduction of the proposed RR-D-ANM compared with benchmark methods is provided as well, which is verified by our simulation results.},

A procedure is designed to account for correlations in the detection maps. This prevents the issue of the multiple detections of a single source and corrects the number of effective independent tests performed.

  abstract = {Condition monitoring is an important asset in the industry to improve the safety and efficiency of the production chain. However, in heavy machinery – such as edge trimmers in steel mills – it is often impractical and unsafe to install intrusive sensors to get the data needed for condition monitoring. Non-intrusive monitoring techniques based, e.g., on acoustic data captured by microphones placed in the vicinity of the assembly being monitored are attractive options. Our application deals with the acoustic monitoring of rotational blades cutting steel strips at high speeds. Knowing the correct period of the cutting process is important for quality evaluation purposes. We propose two novel robust methods to estimate the periodicity based on the audio captured by a microphone near the blades. One is an improved autocorrelation function and the other is based on linear regression, both using incorporating an novel test for the correctness of the estimated period. We compare our methods against the standard autocorrelation-based periodicity measurement techniques on real data recordings. The proposed method estimates the correct period about 87% of the time, compared to an accuracy of only 51% using standard periodicity measurement approaches.},

Random matrix theory provides accurate estimates for this threshold if the underlying data matrix has independent identically distributed columns. However, in time series analysis, the underlying data matrix has a Hankel or Toeplitz structure, and the columns are not independent. Using an empirical approach, we observe that the largest eigenvalue is fitted well by a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, and we obtain accurate estimates for the thresholds to be used in a sequential rank detection test. In contrast to AIC or MDL, this provides a parameter that controls the probability of false alarm. Also a lower bound is presented for the rank detection rate of threshold-based detection for rank-1 problems.},

  abstract = {Classical Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods rarely attain exact separation, even under noiseless conditions. In addition, they often rely on particular structural or statistical assumptions (e.g., mutual independence) regarding the sources. In this work we consider a (realistic) {"}twist{"} in the classical linear BSS plot, which, quite surprisingly, not only enables perfect separation (under noiseless conditions), but is also free of any assumptions (except for regularity assumptions) regarding the sources or the mixing matrix. In particular, we consider the standard linear mixture model, augmented by a single ancillary, unknown linear mixture of some known linear transformations of the sources. We derive a closed-form expression for an exact algebraic solution, free of any statistical considerations whatsoever, attaining perfect separation in the noiseless case. In addition, we propose a well-behaved solution for the same model in the presence of noise or other measurement inaccuracies. Our derivations are corroborated by several simulation results.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {1946-1950},
  abstract = {A polynomial optimization based blind equalizer (POBE) is proposed. Different from the popular constant modulus algorithm and its variants, the POBE adopts an eighth-order multivariate polynomial as the loss function. Since the loss function is sensitive to phase rotation, the POBE can achieve automatic carrier phase recovery. A gradient descent method with optimal step size is developed for solving the optimization problem. We reveal that this optimal step size is one root of a seventh-order univariate polynomial and hence, can be computed easily. Compared with the blind equalizers based on stochastic gradient descent with empirical step size, which suffers from slow convergence or even divergence, the POBE significantly accelerates the convergence rate. Moreover, it attains a much lower inter-symbol interference (ISI), resulting in a noticeable improvement of equalization performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of POBE over several representative blind equalizers.},

By explicitly modeling the product terms inherent to the LQ model along the iterations of the SNPA scheme, the nonlinear contributions of the mixing are mitigated, thus improving the separation quality. The approach is shown to be relevant in realistic numerical experiments, which further highlight that SNPALQ is robust to noise.},

While this problem is often tackled thanks to deterministic approaches, we focus here, on a stochastic approach based on a memetic algorithm. It relies on the evolution of a population and a local search stage. The main drawback of such algorithms can be their relative slowness. It is the reason why we suggest and implement a parallel strategy to increase the acceptance rate of the original algorithm and thus to accelerate its convergence speed.

  abstract = {Blind multichannel identification has played a crucial role as a prerequisite for channel equalization, speech de-reverberation, and time-delay estimation for decades. Algorithms based on cross-relation (CR) errors have been widely studied, however, these algorithms have been reported to be fundamentally vulnerable to additive noise. Consequently, there have been many studies to improve robustness. Among them, the ℓp-robust normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean-square (ℓp-RNMCFLMS) algorithm was developed recently to blindly identify a single-input-multiple-output system in a reverberant environment. However, the additional penalty functions of conventional algorithms including ℓp-RNMCFLMS are based only on the magnitude spectra of the microphone channels. In this work, we propose a new penalty function applied to the phase spectra of the system. Furthermore, we develop an extended ℓp-RNMCFLMS to improve the steady-state performance by discriminating p values on impulse responses separated into significant and insignificant components. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms even in low-SNR conditions.},

  abstract = {Multi-channel RF signal acquisition is a typical requirement in modern communications and radar applications. The use of multiple general-purpose Software-Defined-Radio receivers, connected to a host via USB interface, seems to be an attractive solution since it allows a high number of channels to be obtained with relatively low hardware cost and system weight. Unfortunately, such an architecture usually introduces some inter-channel phase-shifts and time-delays due to hardware limitations, and thus requires calibration routines. In this paper we present a calibration method that is based on pilot signals generated in additional hardware part and injected into the input RF signals. The system extended with such a calibration circuit was used during a field PCL measurement campaign and hours of the recorded signals have been processed offline with the proposed algorithm. The obtained results prove that it is possible to estimate the time delays and phase shifts in practice using the described solution even in the case of low SNR values and time-varying carrier frequency of the pilot signals.},

  abstract = {The so-called block-term decomposition (BTD) tensor model has been recently receiving increasing attention due to its enhanced ability of representing systems and signals that are composed of blocks of rank higher than one, a scenario encountered in numerous diverse applications. Its uniqueness and approximation have thus been thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, the problem of estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms and their individual ranks, has only recently started to attract significant attention, as it is more challenging compared to more classical tensor models such as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition (TD). This paper reports our recent results on this topic, which are based on an appropriate extension to the BTD model of our earlier rank-revealing work on low-rank matrix approximation. The idea is to impose column sparsity jointly on the factors and successively estimate the ranks as the numbers of factor columns of non-negligible magnitude, with the aid of alternating iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS). Simulation results are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately estimating both the ranks and the factors of the least squares BTD approximation.},

We focus on fully-connected network topologies, in which case the distributed algorithm reduces the communication bottleneck by only sharing a compressed version of the observed signals at each given node. Despite this compression, the algorithm can be shown to converge to the maximal trace ratio as if all nodes would have access to all signals in the network. We provide simulation results to demonstrate the convergence and optimality properties of the proposed algorithm.},

The requisite solution steps and the derivation of closed form updates for the transforms and associated coefficients are given. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using two real-life datasets and comparisons with the state-of-the-art dictionary and transform learning techniques for regression are presented. Results show that the deep network has superior performance compared to other methods as it is able to learn the data representation more effectively than the other shallow variants.

A number of recent low rank tensor methods have successfully utilised the tensor singular value decomposition method with tensor nuclear norm minimisation via tensor singular value thresholding. This approach while proving to be effective has the potential issue that it may over or under shrink the singular values which will effect the overall performance. A truncated nuclear norm based method has been introduced which explicitly exploits the low rank assumption within the optimization in combination with tensor singular value thresholding. In this work the truncated nuclear norm approach is extended to incorporate a data driven approach based on Stein’s unbiased risk estimation method which efficiently thresholds the singular values. Experimental results in a colour image denoising problem demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.},

While the subject-dependent system achieved error rate of 0.15% in controlled scenario, this increased up to 15.33% for subject-independent system in natural scenario. The proposed i-vector augmentation provided 26% relative error rate reduction. The subject identification system based on i-vectors and cosine similarity calculation achieved over 68% recognition accuracy in natural scenario.},

  abstract = {Dictionary learning aims to find a dictionary that can sparsely represent the training data. Methods in the literature typically solve the problem by alternating between two stages: sparse coding and dictionary update. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning algorithm using rank-one projection (ROP). The key contribution is that we cast dictionary learning as an optimization with respect to a single variable which is a set of rank one matrices. The resulting algorithm is hence single-stage. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is derived to solve the optimization problem and a lower bound of penalty parameter is computed to guarantee a global convergence despite non-convexity of the optimization formulation. From practical point of view, ROP reduces the number of tuning parameters required in benchmark algorithms. Numerical tests demonstrate that ROP outperforms benchmark algorithms for both synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {Non–negative signals form an important class of sparse signals. Many algorithms have already been proposed to recover such non-negative representations, where greedy and convex relaxed algorithms are among the most popular methods. The greedy techniques are low computational cost algorithms, which have also been modified to incorporate the non-negativity of the representations. One such modification has been pro-posed for Matching Pursuit (MP) based algorithms, which first chooses positive coefficients and uses a non-negative optimisation technique that guarantees the non–negativity of the coefficients. The performance of greedy algorithms, like all non–exhaustive search methods, suffer from high coherence with the linear generative model, called the dictionary. We here first reformulate the non–negative matching pursuit algorithm in the form of a deep neural network. We then show that the proposed model after training yields a significant improvement in terms of exact recovery performance, compared to other non–trained greedy algorithms, while keeping the complexity low.},

  abstract = {The problem of computing a proper sparse representation matrix for a signal matrix that obeys some local smoothness property, given an over-complete dictionary, is considered. The focus is on piece-wise smooth signals, defined as signals that comprise a number of blocks that each fulfills the considered smoothness property. A computationally efficient sparse coding algorithm is derived by limiting the number of times that a new support set of dictionary atoms is computed, exploiting the smoothness of the signal. Furthermore, a new, total-variation regularized problem is proposed for computing the required sparse coding coefficients, exploiting further the smoothness priors of the signals. The considered problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, numerical results considering hyperspectral images are provided, that demonstrate the applicability and complexity -denoising performance benefits of the novel algorithms.},

The DeepFPC-ℓ2 method shows higher signal reconstruction accuracy and convergence speed than the traditional FPC-ℓ2 algorithm. Furthermore, we compare its robustness to noise with the previously proposed DeepFPC network—which stemmed from unfolding the FPC-ℓ1 algorithm—for different signal to noise ratio (SNR) and sign-flipped ratio (flip ratio) scenarios. We show that the proposed network has better noise immunity than the previous DeepFPC method. This result indicates that the robustness of a deep-unfolded neural network is related with that of the algorithm it stems from.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {2065-2069},
  abstract = {Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL), initially proposed in the Machine Learning (ML) literature, is an efficient and well-studied framework for sparse signal recovery. SBL uses hierarchical Bayes with a decorrelated Gaussian prior in which the variance profile is also to be estimated. This is more sparsity inducing than e.g. a Laplacian prior. However, SBL does not scale with problem dimensions due to the computational complexity associated with the matrix inversion in Linear Mimimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) estimation. To address this issue, various low complexity approximate Bayesian inference techniques have been introduced for the LMMSE component, including Variational Bayesian (VB) inference, Space Alternating Variational Estimation (SAVE) or Message Passing (MP) algorithms such as Belief Propagation (BP) or Expectation Propagation (EP) or Approximate MP (AMP). These algorithms may converge to the correct LMMSE estimate. However, in ML we are often also interested in having posterior variance information. We observed that SBL via SAVE provides (largely) underestimated variance estimates. AMP style algorithms may provide more accurate variance information (per component) as we have shown recently. However, one practical issue associated with most AMP versions is that they may diverge even if for a slight deviation from i.i.d Gaussian or right orthogonally invariant measurement matrices. To this end we extend here the more robust Swept AMP (SwAMP) algorithm to Generalized SwAMP (GSwAMP), which handles independent but non-i.i.d. priors and to the case of dynamic SBL. The simulations illustrate the desirable convergence behavior of the proposed GSwAMP-SBL under different scenarios on the measurement matrix.},

Pulse pile-up and dead time losses lead to wrong measurements of both the number of pulses and their amplitude. Current techniques based on maxima detection, be in analog domain or after fine digitalization, offer limited resolution, bounded by the instrument response function (IRF). In this work we show how spectral sampling can help breaking the current limits of gamma-ray spectrometry. By means of a sparsity-based sensing model and using a fast and robust parametric spectral estimation method, we show that the unknown parameters, namely time of arrival and energy of the γ-photons, can be accurately estimated from few m ≥ 2K + 1 frequency samples. In the noiseless case parameter estimation is exact to machine precision and the method has virtually no resolution limit. A thorough experimental evaluation using an empirical IRF unveiled excellent performance, even in overpessimistic conditions.},

However, due to fundamental limitations of light propagation we can only measure the object indirectly via 2D intensity measurements of the 3D specimen through highly nonlinear projection mappings where a variety of information (including phase) is lost. Reconstruction therefore involves inverting highly non-linear and seemingly noninvertible mappings. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique where the 3D object is directly reconstructed from an accurate non-linear propagation model. Furthermore, we characterize the ambiguities of this model and leverage a priori knowledge to mitigate their effect and also significantly reduce the required number of measurements and hence the acquisition time. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via numerical experiments aimed at nano-scale reconstruction of 3D integrated circuits. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for convergence to stationarity.},

In this contribution, we develop a HO method that relies on the structure of proximal gradient methods and does not require a smooth cost function.

In this paper we propose a convex optimization-based subspace perturbation approach to solve privacy-preserving distributed least squares problems. Based on the primal-dual method of multipliers, the introduced dual variables will only converge in a subspace determined by the graph topology and do not converge in its orthogonal complement. We, therefore, propose to exploit this property for privacy-preservation by using the nonconverging part of the dual variables to perturb the private data, thereby protecting it from being revealed. Moreover, we prove that the proposed approach is secure under both eavesdropping and passive adversaries. Computer simulations are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach through its convergence properties and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Average consensus algorithms are used in many distributed systems such as distributed optimization, sensor fusion and the control of dynamic systems. Consensus algorithms converge through an explicit exchange of state variables. In some cases, however, the state variables are confidential. In this paper, a privacy-preserving asynchronous distributed average consensus method is proposed, which decomposes the initial values into two states; alpha states and beta states. These states are initialized such that their sum is twice the initial value. The alpha states are used to communicate with the other nodes, while the beta states are used internally. Although beta states are not shared, they are used in the update of the alpha states. Unlike differential privacy based methods, the proposed algorithm achieves the exact average consensus, while providing privacy to the initial values. Compared to the synchronous state decomposition algorithm, the convergence rate is improved without any privacy compromise. As the variances of coupling weights become infinitely large, the semi-honest adversary does not have any range to estimate the initial value of the nodes given that there is at least one coupling weight hidden from the adversary.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering a signal from nonlinear transformations, under convex constraints modeling a priori information. Standard feasibility and optimization methods are ill-suited to tackle this problem due to the nonlinearities. We show that, in many common applications, the transformation model can be associated with fixed point equations involving firmly nonexpansive operators. In turn, the recovery problem is reduced to a tractable common fixed point formulation, which is solved efficiently by a provably convergent, block-iterative algorithm. Applications to signal and image recovery are demonstrated. Inconsistent problems are also addressed.},

In this paper, we formulate a flexible joint source separation model termed as group nonnegative matrix factorization with sparse regularization (GNMF-SR), which aims to jointly analyze the partially coupled multi-set data. In the GNMF-SR model, common and individual patterns of particular underlying factors can be extracted simultaneously with imposing nonnegative constraint and sparse penalty. Alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are combined to solve the GNMF-SR model. Using the experiment of simulated fMRI-like data, we demonstrate the ADMM-based GNMF-SR algorithm can achieve the better performance.},

CR is important in many domains and one of its workhorses is the non-parametric least square estimator (LSE). Currently, LSE delivers only non-smooth non-strongly convex function estimates. In this paper, leveraging recent results in convex interpolation, we generalize LSE to smooth strongly convex regression problems. The resulting algorithm relies on a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We also propose a parallel implementation, which leverages ADMM, that lessens the overall computational complexity to a tight O(n2) for n observations. Numerical results support our findings.},

The proposed reformulation of the algorithm allows us to include more sophisticated priors while inheriting the row-wise operation structure of the classical Kaczmarz algorithm. The new method is developed with help of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The results show that also with suboptimal alternating direction method of multiplier steps, the proposed algorithm is able to solve convex optimization problems with very high accuracy. Especially, on the relative young preclinical medical imaging modality of magnetic particle imaging, the algorithm demonstrates high convergence rates. When the underlying matrix nearly shows mutually orthogonal rows, which is observed in the field of magnetic particle imaging, very high convergence rates can be expected.},

  abstract = {The proximal gradient algorithm is a popular iterative algorithm to deal with penalized least-squares minimization problems. Its simplicity and versatility allow one to embed nonsmooth penalties efficiently. In the context of inverse problems arising in signal and image processing, a major concern lies in the computational burden when implementing minimization algorithms. For instance, in tomographic image reconstruction, a bottleneck is the cost for applying the forward linear operator and its adjoint [1], [2]. Consequently, it often happens that these operators are approximated numerically, so that the adjoint property is no longer fulfilled. In this paper, we focus on the proximal gradient algorithm stability properties when such an adjoint mismatch arises. By making use of tools from convex analysis and fixed point theory, we establish conditions under which the algorithm can still converge to a fixed point. We provide bounds on the error between this point and the solution to the minimization problem. We illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results through numerical examples in the context of computed tomography.},

However, privacy has become one of the biggest challenges holding back the widespread adoption of these tools for processing sensitive data. As a step towards a solution, we demonstrate the privacy-preserving capabilities of variants of the so-called distributed graph filters. Such implementations allow each node to compute a desired linear transformation of the networked data while protecting its own private data. In particular, the proposed approach eliminates the risk of possible privacy abuse by ensuring that the private data is only available to its owner. Moreover, it preserves the distributed implementation and keeps the same communication and computational cost as its non-secure counterparts. Furthermore, we show that this computational model is secure under both passive and eavesdropping adversary models. Finally, its performance is demonstrated by numerical tests and it is shown to be a valid and competitive privacy-preserving alternative to traditional distributed optimization techniques.},

These weights are learned from the data, thus allowing the use of signal anti-correlation on connected nodes in order to perform a more robust interpolation.

Recently, graph-regularized approaches aim to tackle this problem by learning a linear representation of data samples and also a graph structure in a unified framework.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm based on joint low-rank decomposition and graph learning from data samples. In graph learning, only a low-rank component of the representation matrix is employed to construct the graph embedding term. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is further developed to tackle the resulting nonconvex problem. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real benchmark databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed SC algorithm.},

A preprocessing of the measurements is required since the station has experienced some technical failures and there are thus some gaps in the measured data.

  abstract = {The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) provides a multi-resolution representation of a signal by scaling a mother wavelet and convolving it with the signal. The scalogram (squared modulus of the CWT) then represents the spread of the signal's energy as a function of time and scale. The scalogram has constant relative temporal resolution but, as the scale is compressed (frequency increased), it loses frequency resolution. To compensate for this, the recently-introduced superlets geometrically combine a set of wavelets with increasing frequency resolution to achieve time-frequency super-resolution. The number of wavelets in the set is called the order of the superlet and was initially defined as an integer number. This creates a series of issues when adaptive superlets are implemented, i.e. superlets whose order depends on frequency. In particular, adaptive superlets generate representations that suffer from {"}banding{"} because the order is adjusted in discrete steps as the frequency increases. Here, by relying on the weighted geometric mean, we introduce fractional superlets, which allow the order to be a fractional number. We show that fractional adaptive superlets provide high-resolution representations that are smooth across the entire spectrum and are clearly superior to representations based on the discrete adaptive superlets.},

  abstract = {The analytic wavelet packet transform, based on the dual-tree approach, represents a complex-valued extension of the wavelet packet transform. A generalization to multiple dimensions can be realized using fully separable wavelet trees, but this restricts the possible subband combinations. To overcome these limitations, we present a flexible framework to calculate N-D analytic wavelet packets with configurable decomposition structures and filter types. By introducing a new subband notation for the nodes of the N-D wavelet binary tree, both anisotropic and isotropic decomposition structures can be realized. Based on this subband notation, a full frame in N dimensions is defined and combined with an optimal basis selection, which we generalized to arbitrary dimensions, to find signal-adapted decomposition structures. As a multi-dimensional example, the framework is applied to the compression and denoising of a 4D light field. The results are evaluated in terms of the PSNR and SSIM and compared with the discrete cosine transform.},

Typically, pulsed radar systems result in the backscattered, demodulated, and matched signal having a chirp signal structure, with the frequency rate being related to the range to the reflecting target and the relative velocity of the transmitter and reflector. Far from the target, and at low relative velocities, one may achieve preferable location estimates by neglecting the frequency rate, treating the received signal as being purely sinusoidal, whereas at close range, neglecting the frequency rate notably reduces the achievable performance. Using misspecified estimation theory, we derive a lower bound of the achievable performance when neglecting the true signal structure, and show at which ranges one model is preferable to the other. Numerical results from a mm-wave radar system illustrate the results.},

Field estimation aims to estimate and interpolate the physical quantities of fields, e.g., temperature and sound pressure, in an entire region of interest, where Gaussian processes are typically used for modeling. Although a number of sensor placement methods are proposed in the literature, in most of the methods, an optimization criterion is evaluated only at the candidate positions of the sensors. However, a region in which sensors are placed is sometimes restricted in practical applications of field estimation. To overcome this issue, we formulate a cost function on the basis of the expected squared error inside the target region for field estimation, which is derived by Gaussian process regression. We also propose two algorithms, the greedy algorithm and convex relaxation method, to efficiently solve this optimization problem. Numerical simulation results indicated that our proposed method achieves accurate field estimation even when the placement region of sensor candidates is restricted.},

In this paper, we extend the structure of S/H ADCs, allowing them to harvest energy from the observed signal by modifying the circuitry during hold time of the sampling process of an ADC. This harvested energy can be used to supplement the ADC itself, paving the way to the possibility of zero power and power saving ADCs. We analyze the tradeoff between the ability to accurately recover the sampled signal and the energy harvesting which arises from the proposed ADC architecture, and provide guidelines to setting the sampling rate in light of accuracy and energy constraints. Our numerical evaluations indicate that energy harvesting ADCs operating with up to 16 bits per sample can acquire analog signals such that they can be recovered with minimal errors without requiring power from the external source.},

In the proposed method, the reconstruction is performed by iterating on a convex combination of region-limiting and bandlimiting operations.

The advantage of this approach is that arbitrary high-dynamic-range signals can be recovered without sensor saturation or clipping. In this paper, we prove a multidimensional version of the unlimited sampling theorem that works with arbitrary sampling lattices. We also present a geometrical perspective on the emerging class of modulo sampling problem that is based on the topology of quotient spaces.},

This expansion, in which we make use of conjugate-reversal of the coefficient set, brings about greatly increased sharpening applicability. Our new structure joins two recently-introduced two-path structures in comparison exercises here. Three of these four offer the option of linear-phase sharpened resultants and comprise what we believe to be the most versatile FIR sharpeners available for effective flattening of two-level gain plateaus in multiband filtering scenarios. All four are compared in complex-valued impulse response example settings, and we arrive at clear ranking of their merits.},

In this paper we review the features of three available methods and also introduce a new sharpener that operates with no restrictions on phase conditions for prototypes and without requiring root-finding. The use of conjugate-reversal of numerator coefficient vectors, along with prototype pairing and allpass filtering, combine to facilitate robust internal sharpener delay alignment.

  abstract = {The ever-increasing volume and complexity of time series data, emerging in various application domains, necessitate efficient dimensionality reduction for facilitating data mining tasks. Symbolic representations, among them symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), have proven very effective in compacting the information content of time series while exploiting the wealth of search algorithms used in bioinformatics and text mining communities. However, typical SAX-based techniques rely on a Gaussian assumption for the underlying data statistics, which often deteriorates their performance in practical scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a method that negates any assumption on the probability distribution of time series. Specifically, a data-driven kernel density estimator is first applied on the data, followed by Lloyd-Max quantization to determine the optimal horizontal segmentation breakpoints. Experimental evaluation on distinct datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and tightness of lower bound, when compared against the conventional and a modified SAX method.},

  abstract = {Adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) provides an expansion of an analytic function into a sum of basic signals, called mono-components. Unlike the Fourier series decomposition, the AFD is based on an adaptive rational orthogonal system, hence it is better suited for analyzing non-stationary data. The most popular algorithm for the AFD decomposes any signal in such a way that the energy of the low-frequency components is maximized. Unfortunately, this results in poor energy compaction of high-frequency components. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for the AFD. The key idea is to maximize the energy of any components no matter how big or small the corresponding frequencies are. A comparative evaluation was conducted of the signal reconstruction efficiency of the proposed approach and several conventional algorithms by using speech recordings. The experimental results show that with the new algorithm, it is possible to get a better performance in terms of the reconstruction quality and energy compaction property.},

  abstract = {Many inverse problems in imaging require estimating the parameters of a bi-linear model, e.g., the crisp image and the blur in blind deconvolution. In all these models, there is a scaling indetermination: multiplication of one term by an arbitrary factor can be compensated for by dividing the other by the same factor.To solve such inverse problems and identify each term of the bi-linear model, reconstruction methods rely on prior models that enforce some form of regularity. If these regularization terms verify a homogeneity property, the optimal scaling with respect to the regularization functions can be determined. This has two benefits: hyper-parameter tuning is simplified (a single parameter needs to be chosen) and the computation of the maximum a posteriori estimate is more efficient.Illustrations on a blind deconvolution problem are given with an unsupervised strategy to tune the hyper-parameter.},

  year = {2020},
  pages = {2363-2367},
  abstract = {Modern wireless communication systems have tighten the requirements of adaptive beamformers when implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The set requirements imposed additional constraints such as designing a high throughput, low complexity system with fast convergence and low steady state error. Recently, a parallel multi-stage least mean square (pLMS) structure is proposed to mitigate the listed constraints. pLMS is a two stages least mean square (LMS) operating in parallel and connected by an error feedback. To form the total pLMS error, the second LMS stage (LMS2) error is delayed by one sample and fed-back to combine with that of the first LMS stage (LMS1). pLMS provides accelerated convergence while maintaining minimal steady state error and a computational complexity of order O(N), where N represent the number of antenna elements. However, pipelining the pLMS structure is still difficult due to the LMS coefficient update loop. Thus, in this paper, we propose the application of the delay and sum relaxed look ahead technique to design a high throughput pipelined hardware architecture for the pLMS. Hence, the delayed pLMS (DpLMS) is obtained. Simulation and synthesis result, highlight the superior performance of the DpLMS in presenting a high throughput architecture while preserving accelerated convergence, low steady state error and low computational complexity. DpLMS operates at a maximum frequency of 208.33 MHz and is obtained at the cost of a marginal increase in resource requirements, i.e. additional delay registers compared to the original pLMS design.},

In particular, adaptive filters for functional link polynomial (FLiP) filters, a broad class of linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) nonlinear filters, are considered. FLiP filters include many popular LIP filters, as the Volterra filters, the Wiener nonlinear filters, and many others. Given the large number of coefficients of these filters modeling real systems, especially for high orders, the solution is often very sparse. Thus, an adaptive filter exploiting sparsity is considered, the improved proportionate NLMS algorithm (IPNLMS), and an optimal step-size is obtained for the filter. The optimal step-size alters the characteristics of the IPNLMS algorithm and provides a novel gradient descent adaptive filter. Simulation results involving the identification of a real nonlinear device illustrate the achievable performance in comparison with competing similar approaches.},

However, exploiting the frequency information conveyed by financial data, could yield improved insights about the inherent risk evolution in a joint time-frequency fashion. Nevertheless, the great majority of risk managers make no explicit distinction between the information captured by patterns of different frequency content, while relying on the full time-resolution data, regardless of the trading horizon. To address this problem, a novel value-at-risk (VaR) quantification method is proposed, which combines nonlinearly the time-evolving energy profile of returns series at multiple frequency scales, determined by the predefined trading horizon. Most importantly, our proposed method can be coupled with any quantile-based risk measure to enhance its performance. Experimental evaluation with real data reveals an increased robustness of our method in efficiently controlling under-/over-estimated VaR values.},

The latter is subtracted from the integrated process. The power of the residual is then computed and corresponds to the square of the fluctuation function. Its logarithm is proportional to the Hurst exponent. In the last few years, a few variants of this method have been proposed and differ in the way of estimating the trend. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we introduce a new variant of the DFA, based on a regularized least-square criterion to estimate the trend. Then, the influence of the regularization parameter on the fluctuation function is analyzed in two cases: when the process is wide sense stationary and when it is not. Finally, an application is presented in the field of aeronautics to characterize an attentional impairment: the visual tunneling.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) filtering algorithm for networked systems where uncertain delays and packet dropouts can happen due to measurement failures and unreliable communication. The binary Bernoulli distribution with known delay probability is used to model the randomly arrived measures. A novel representation of the stochastic model is presented for FIR-type filter structures. To avoid packet dropouts and improve the estimation accuracy when a message arrives with no data, a predictive algorithm is used. An advantage of the UFIR filtering approach is demonstrated by comparing the mean square errors with the Kalman and H∞ filters under the same conditions. Experimental verifications are provided based on GPS vehicle tracking.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating spectral and range profiles from single-photon Lidar waveforms associated with single surfaces in presence of an unknown background. A single Lidar waveform per pixel is considered, whereby a single detector is used to acquire information simultaneously at multiple wavelengths. A novel Bayesian approach is developed to perform the estimation of model parameters in a reduced computational time. This is achieved by transforming an EM-based algorithm recently proposed into a stochastic EM algorithm, which is computationally more attractive. The reconstruction performance and computational complexity of our approach are assessed through a series of experiments using synthetic data under different observation scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate a significant speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art method, without significant degradation of the estimation quality.},

  pages = {2423-2427},
  abstract = {As data analysis methods, hypothesis testing and regression analysis are famous. However, the hypothesis testing can only detect significant differences between two groups divided by some characteristic or some empirical threshold, and the regression analysis can only construct one averaged model whose information is limited. Quantile regression is a robust and flexible analysis method, and can construct multilevel models, e.g., the median and the first and third quartiles. To make the most of the quantile regression, existing papers employed spline regression models as generalizations of polynomial regression models, but the regression of each level was individually executed. In this paper, we propose simultaneous spline quantile regression which considers the similarity between the adjacent quantiles. Further, the proposed method enforces the non-crossing and one shape (non-decreasing/non-increasing/convex/concave) constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method recovers harmonious quantiles.},

  abstract = {The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used in many applications to decide whether the outcomes of different experiments are the same or not. Nevertheless, one of the most restrictive assumptions made by ANOVA is to suppose that all the experiments have the same variance. This may not be common in many applications as it is the case of spoofing detection in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Moreover, there may be cases in which the experimental data is complex with different variances for the real and imaginary components. For these reasons, in this paper, we provide a general formulation of ANOVA and we show its application to spoofing detection in GNSS. Numerical results will show the superiority of the proposed generalized ANOVA solution with respect to traditional ANOVA and state-of-the-art techniques for spoofing detection in GNSS.},

Starting from the consensus+innovations approach, we present two robust communication schemes that are insensitive to the contaminating distribution. After deriving upper bounds for the variances of the estimators, a sequential scheme is designed at every sensor such that i) detection and estimation errors are limited for all possible contaminating distributions ii) the resulting scheme uses a minimum number of samples on average. A numerical example validates the proposed method.},

The selected variables are communicated to a fusion center (FC) in which the variables for the complete data are chosen using a majority voting rule. In the second stage, confidence intervals and parameter estimates are found in each node using robust τ-estimator combined with bootstrapping and then combined in FC. The simulation results demonstrate the validity and reliability of the algorithm in variable selection and constructing confidence intervals even if the estimation problem in the subsets is slightly underdetermined.},

Then, these heatmaps are back-projected onto the 3D terrain of the navigation environment. The projected crowd heatmaps are fused by exploiting a Bayesian filtering approach that favors newer crowd observations over older ones. Thus, during flight, an area is marked as crowded (therefore, a no-fly zone) if all, or most, UAV-mounted visual detectors have recently and confidently indicated crowd existence on it. Empirical evaluation on synthetic multiview video sequences depicting human crowds in outdoor environments verifies the efficiency of the proposed method against the no-fusion case.},
