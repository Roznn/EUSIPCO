  abstract = {Kernel adaptive filters (KAFs) are powerful tools for online nonlinear system modeling, which are direct extensions of traditional linear adaptive filters in kernel space, with growing linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) structure. However, like most other nonlinear adaptive filters, the KAFs are “black box” models where no prior information about the unknown nonlinear system is utilized. If some prior information is available, the “grey box” models may achieve improved performance. In this work, we consider the kernel adaptive filtering with prior information in terms of equality function constraints. A novel Mercer kernel, called the constrained Mercer kernel (CMK), is proposed. With this new kernel, we develop the kernel least mean square subject to equality function constraints (KLMS-EFC), which can satisfy the constraints perfectly while achieving significant performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Adaptive filters for Volterra system identification must deal with two difficulties: large filter length M (resulting in high computational complexity and low convergence rate) and high correlation in the input sequence. The second problem is minimized by using the recursive least-squares algorithm (RLS), however, its large computation complexity (O(M2)) might be prohibitive in some applications. We propose here a low-complexity RLS algorithm, based on the dichotomous coordinate descent algorithm (DCD), showing that in some situations the computational complexity is reduced to O(M). The new algorithm is compared to the standard RLS, normalized least-mean squares (NLMS) and affine projections (AP) algorithms.},

  abstract = {Traditional active noise control (ANC) systems, which uses a fixed tap length adaptive filter as the controller may lead to non optimal noise mitigation. In addition, the conventional filtered-x least mean square algorithm based ANC schemes fail to effectively perform noise cancellation in the presence of nonlinearities in the ANC environment. In order to overcome these limitations of traditional ANC techniques, in this paper, we propose a class of dynamic nonlinear ANC systems, which adapts itself to the noise cancellation scenario. The dynamic behaviour has been achieved by developing a variable tap length and variable learning rate adaptive algorithms for functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) and generalized FLANN (GFLANN) based ANC systems. The proposed ANC schemes have been shown through a simulation study to provide an optimal convergence behaviour. This improvement has been achieved by providing a balance between the number of filter coefficients and the mean square error.},

Multi-level expectation maximization (EM) is used for clustering the recorded 40-Hz auditory steady state response signals recorded from human subjects. The clustering information is used to define the depth of anaesthesia index. Rather than extracting the maximum amplitude and frequency at each cycle as clustering features, principal components analysis (PCA) is used for analyzing all samples of the cycles and projecting data into a lower dimension space. Both dimension reduction and clustering schemes are unsupervised methods, hence the algorithm does not need initial data labeling or training phase.},

The approach employs the recent HIKOB sensors for tracking the GPS position of each bike and the problem herein addressed is to transmit this information to a collector for visualization or other processing. Our approach exploits the inherent correlation between biker motions and aggregates GPS data at sensors using compressive sensing (CS) techniques. We enforce, instead of the standard signal sparsity, a spatial sparsity prior on biker motion because of the grouping behavior (peloton) in bike races. The spatial sparsity is modeled by a graphical model and the CS-based data aggregation problem is solved using linear programming. Our approach, integrated in a multi-round opportunistic routing protocol, is validated on data generated by a bike race simulator using trajectories of motorbikes obtained from a real race, the Paris-Tours 2013.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {56-60},
  abstract = {In compressed sensing (CS) framework, a signal is sampled below Nyquist rate, and the acquired samples are generally random in nature. Thus, for efficient estimation of the actual signal, the sensing matrix must preserve the relative distances among the underlying sparse vectors. Provided this condition is fulfilled, we show that CS samples will also preserve the envelope of the actual signal. Exploiting this envelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast method which is able to extract prototype signals from compressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of signals. These prototype signals are orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted from CS samples using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is one of the popular methods to capture the envelope of a signal. The extracted IMFs are used to seed the dictionary without even comprehending the original signal or the sensing matrix. Moreover, one can update the dictionary on-line as new CS samples are available. In particularly, to recover first L signals (ϵ Rn) at the decoder, one can seed the dictionary in just O(nL log n) operations, that is far less as compared to existing approaches. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally for recovery of speech signals.},

Knowledge of propagation path parameters such as complex channel gain, propagation delay or angle-of-arrival provides valuable information on the user position and facilitates channel response estimation. A major challenge in channel parameter estimation lies in its multidimensional nature, which leads to large-scale estimation problems which are difficult to solve. Current approaches of sparse recovery for multidimensional parameter estimation aim at simultaneously estimating all channel parameters by solving one large-scale estimation problem. In contrast to that we propose a sparse recovery method which relies on decomposing the multidimensional problem into successive one-dimensional parameter estimation problems, which are much easier to solve and less sensitive to off-grid effects, while providing proper parameter pairing. Our proposed decomposition relies on convex optimization in terms of nuclear norm minimization and we present an efficient implementation in terms of the recently developed STELA algorithm.},

Since high-quality image signal processing often comes along with a high computational complexity, a parallel execution is desirable. The proposed framework allows for the application of existing image signal extrapolation algorithms without the need to modify them for a parallel processing. The unaltered application of existing algorithms is achieved by dividing input images into overlapping tiles which are distributed to compute nodes via Message Passing Interface. In order to keep the computational overhead low, a novel image tiling algorithm is proposed. Using this algorithm, a nearly optimum tiling is possible at a very small processing time. For showing the efficacy of the framework, it is used for parallelizing a high-complexity extrapolation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed framework has no negative impact on extrapolation quality while at the same time offering good scaling behavior on compute clusters.},

The first advantage of this formulation is that it only processes the corrupted depth and intensity images obtained from preliminary estimation, without the need for the use of full TCSPC waveforms. The second advantage is its flexibility in being able to use different convex regularization terms such as: total variation (TV); and sparsity of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. The estimation problems are efficiently solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that presents good convergence properties and thus a reduced computational cost. Results on single photon depth data from field trials show the benefit of the proposed strategy that improves the quality of the estimated depth and intensity images.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to estimate non-integer shift of images based on least squares approximation in the phase region. Conventional methods based on Phase Only Correlation (POC) take correlation between a image and its shifted image, and then estimate the non-integer shift by fitting the model equation. The problem with using POC is that the true peak of the POC function may not match the estimated peak of the fitted model equation. This causes error in non-integer shift estimation. By calculating directly in the phase region, the proposed method allows the estimation of decimal shift through least squares approximation. Also by utilizing the characteristics of the natural image, the proposed method limits adoption range for least squares approximation. By these improvements, the proposed method improves the estimation and achieves high accuracy.},

Here, we assume transmission channels with data erasure such as a packet-based network. Multiple description coding is a coding method used to achieve “graceful degradation” when transmitting signals through lossy channels. The proposed method is inspired by the vector quantizer design of Poggi et al., which combines VQ design based on the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multiple description scalar quantizer (MDSQ). The method also uses the SOM-based VQ; the difference is that the proposed method combines a bit-error-tolerant VQ designed by SOM and a novel scheme for cell arrangement of SOM based on Redundant Representation of Central Code (RRCC). The method is not only easy to design for any bit rate but is also more robust against data erasure compared with the conventional VQ.},

So it is expected that activation coefficient matrices of their NMF decomposition are similar. Based on this similarity, in this paper the activation coefficient matrix of the video modality is used as an initialization for audio source separation via NMF. In addition, the mentioned similarity is used for post-processing and for clustering the rows of the activation coefficient matrix which were resulted from randomly initialized NMF.

However, a severe self-interference (SI) due to the large difference between the power of the devices' own transmission and that of the signal of interest may be imposed on the FD based devices, thus significantly eroding the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To implement the FD devices, the SI power must be sufficiently suppressed to provide a high-enough received SINR for satisfying the decoding requirement. In this paper, the design and implementation of the duplexer for facilitating SI cancellation in FD based devices are investigated, with a new type of duplexer (i.e. an improved directional coupler) designed and verified. It is shown that the SI suppression capability may be up to 36 dB by using the proposed design, which is much higher than that attainable in the commonly designed ferrite circulator.},

  abstract = {Recently, a sliding-window RLS (SRLS) adaptive algorithm based on dynamic regularization, involving a time- and tap-varying diagonal loading (VDL), has been proposed, which is equivalent to the proportionate affine projection algorithm (PAPA) used for sparse identification. The complexity of this SRLS algorithm is significantly lower than the PAPA complexity. However, its identification performance (the same as the PAPA performance) does not approach that of the oracle SRLS algorithm. We propose here a new version of the SRLS-VDL algorithm that does achieve next-to-oracle performance. We arrive at this algorithm by minimizing the least squares cost function with a penalty. We also propose a modified penalty that takes into account both the sparsity of the unknown system and additive noise. Numerical results with speech signals in an acoustic echo cancellation scenario show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other sparse estimation techniques and its performance is close to the oracle performance.},

The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a data-driven method which can separate a signal into components ideally made of several ridges. Unfortunately EMD is defined as an algorithm output, with no analytical definition. It is our purpose to merge the data-driven nature of EMD with the CWT, performing an adaptive signal decomposition in a time-scale framework. We give here a new mode definition, and develop a new mode extraction algorithm. Two artificial signals are analyzed, and results are compared with those of synchrosqueezing ridge-based decomposition, showing advantages for our proposal.},

According to AA-ASDM, the time-varying envelope function of the input signal is used in the feedback loop to reduce the switching rate of the output trigger and thus the power consumption of the circuit. In previous work, the signal and its envelope function were encoded and transmitted separately, thus resulting in inefficiency, since two signals instead of one were required to be transmitted. In order to solve this inefficiency, in this paper it is proposed to select such a time-varying envelope function which does not require additional encoding and transmission, and still be able to recover the original signal from the obtained time sequence. The proposed method is particularly advantageous for signals with wide dynamic range.},

  abstract = {Adaptive filters that employ sparse constraints or maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) have been derived from stochastic gradient techniques. This paper provides a deterministic optimization framework which unifies the derivation of such algorithms. The proposed framework has also the ability of providing geometric insights about the adaptive filter updating. New algorithms that exploit both impulse responses sparsity and MCC are proposed, and an estimate of their steady-state MSE is advanced.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of the distributed estimation of a parameter vector based on noisy observations regularly acquired by the nodes of a wireless sensor network and assuming that some of the nodes have faulty sensors. We propose two online schemes, both centralized and distributed, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. These algorithms are able to identify and disregard the faulty nodes, and provide a refined estimate of the parameters each time instant after a new set of observations is acquired. Simulation results demonstrate that the centralized versions of the proposed online algorithms attain the same estimation error as the centralized batch EM, whereas the distributed versions come very close to matching the batch EM.},

  abstract = {Cooperative localization capability is a highly desirable characteristic of wireless sensor networks. It has attracted considerable research attention in academia and industry. The sum-product algorithm over a wireless sensor network (SPAWN) is a powerful method to cooperatively estimate the positions of many sensors (agents) using knowledge of the absolute positions of a few sensors (anchors). Drawbacks of the SPAWN, however, are its high computational complexity and communication load. In this paper we address the complexity issue, reformulate it as convolution problem and utilize the fast Fourier transform (FFT), culminating in a fast and accurate localization algorithm, which we named SPAWN-FFT. Our simulation results show SPAWN-FFT's superiority over SPAWN regarding the computational effort, while maintaining its full flexibility and localization performance.},

In the second scenario we quantify the information loss when the considered value of the noise correlation is wrong. It is shown that the noise correlation usually enhances the estimation accuracy and increases information. However, the performance declines if the noise correlation is misdefined, and the two modalities may jointly convey less information than one single modality.},

Prior approaches have mostly used well-engineered speech processing or convex L1-optimization methods to solve the inverse filtering problem. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to modeling the human vocal tract using an unsupervised dictionary learning framework. We make the assumption of an all-pole model of the vocal tract, and derive an L1 regularized least squares loss function for the all-pole approximation. To evaluate the quality of the extracted glottal volume velocity waveform, we conduct experiments on real-life speech datasets, which include vowels and multi-speaker phonetically balanced utterances. We find that the the unsupervised model learns meaningful dictionaries of vocal tracts, and the proposed data-driven unsupervised framework achieves a performance comparable to the IAIF (Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering) glottal flow extraction approach.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a remote state estimation problem where a sensor observes a dynamical process, and transmits local state estimates over an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) packet dropping channel to a remote estimator. The sensor is equipped with energy harvesting capabilities. At every discrete time instant, provided there is enough battery energy, the sensor decides whether it should transmit or not, in order to minimize the expected estimation error covariance at the remote estimator. For transmission schedules dependent only on the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator, the energy available at the sensor, and the harvested energy, we establish structural results on the optimal scheduling which show that for a given battery energy level and a given harvested energy, the optimal policy is a threshold policy on the error covariance, i.e. transmit if and only if the error covariance exceeds a certain threshold. Similarly, for a given error covariance and a given harvested energy, the optimal policy is a threshold policy on the battery level. Numerical studies confirm the qualitative behaviour predicted by our structural results.},

Recovery of the unknowns entails solving a set of bilinear equations, a challenging problem encountered in signal processing tasks such as blind deconvolution for channel equalization or image deblurring. Inspired by the Wirtinger flow approach to the related phase retrieval problem, we propose a solver that proceeds in two steps: (i) first a spectral method is used to obtain an initial guess; which is then (ii) refined using simple and scalable gradient descent iterations to minimize a natural non-convex formulation of the recovery problem. Our method - which we refer to as SIGIBE: Spectral Initialization and Gradient Iterations for Bilinear Equations - can accommodate arbitrary correlations between am and bm. Different from recent approaches to blind deconvolution using convex relaxation, SIGIBE does not require matrix lifting that could hinder the method's scalability. Numerical tests corroborate SIGIBE's effectiveness in various data settings, and show successful recovery with as few as M ≳ (L + P) measurements.},

We have characterized the new metric's stability in multiple measurements, and between subjects in homogenous groups. In this paper we investigated the DTW metric's sensitivity and demonstrated that DTW-based models outperform correlation-based models in resting-state fMRI data classification tasks.

This finding has been observed by statistically comparing the functional connectivity (FC) patterns computed from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data recorded before and after intensive training to a visual attention task. Hence, functional connectivity serves a dynamic role in brain function, supporting the consolidation of previous experience. Following this line of research, we trained three groups of individuals to a visual discrimination task during a magneto-encephalography (MEG) experiment [2]. The same individuals were then scanned in rs-fMRI. Here, in a supervised classification framework, we demonstrate that FC metrics computed on rs-fMRI data are able to predict the type of training the participants received. On top of that, we show that the prediction accuracies based on tangent embedding FC measure outperform those based on our recently developed multivariate wavelet-based Hurst exponent estimator [3], which captures low frequency fluctuations in ongoing brain activity too.},

  abstract = {In this study we investigated how directed functional connectivity can be used to localize the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from ictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. First, simulations were conducted to investigate the performance of two directed functional connectivity measures, the Adaptive Directed Transfer Function (ADTF) and the Adaptive Partial Directed Coherence (APDC), in combinations with two graph measures, the out-degree and the shortest path, to localize the SOZ. Afterwards the method was applied to the seizure of an epileptic patient, recorded with 113-channel iEEG and localization was compared with the subsequent resection that rendered the patient seizure free. We found both in simulations and in the patient data that the ADTF combined with the out-degree and shortest path resulted in correct SOZ localization. We can conclude that ADTF combined with out-degree or shortest path are most optimal to localize the SOZ from a high number of iEEG channels.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous activations in resting-state fMRI have been shown to corroborate recurrent intrinsic functional networks. Recent studies have explored integration of brain function in terms of spatially overlapping networks. We have proposed a method to recover not only spatially but also temporally overlapping networks, which we named innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs). These networks are driven by the sparse innovation signals recovered from Total Activation (TA), a spatiotemporal regularization framework for fMRI deconvolution. The fMRI data is processed with TA, which uses the inverse of the hemodynamic response function - as a linear differential operator - combined with the derivative in the regularization with ℓ1-norm. As a result, sparse innovation signals are reconstructed as the deconvolved fMRI time series. Temporal clustering of innovation signals lead to iCAPs. In this work, we investigate the reproducible iCAPs in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and healthy volunteers.},

We showed that it is possible to obtain far more accurate calibration solutions and also to distribute the compute load across a network of computers by using this technique. A crucial aspect in any consensus optimization problem is the selection of the penalty parameter used in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) iterations. This affects the convergence speed as well as the accuracy. In this paper, we use the Hessian of the cost function used in calibration to appropriately select this penalty. We extend our results to a multi-directional calibration setting, where we propose to use a penalty scaled by the squared intensity of each direction.},

Spatial filters are advantageous in radio astronomy when the separation between RFI and astronomical sources cannot be made in the time or frequency domains. Consequently, the mitigation of the RFI relies on the quality of its spatial signature vector (SSV) estimation. The latter depends on the array calibration information which is investigated in this work.

The role of the preprocessing matrix is to speed-up the convergence of the conventional LMS crosstalk canceler and hence speed-up the convergence of the overall system. The update of the preprocessing matrix is inspired by deep neural networks. However, since all the operations in the Deep-LMS algorithm are linear, we are capable of providing an exact convergence speed analysis. The Deep-LMS is important for crosstalk cancellation in the novel G.fast standard, where traditional LMS converges very slowly due to the large bandwidth.

A typical spectrum coordination algorithm employs an iterative procedure to solve the rate adaptive spectrum management problem.

Recently, the new paradigm of so-called real-time dynamic spectrum management has been defined. This paper presents a simple and powerful framework for real-time spectrum coordination based on bicoordinate ascent methods.

Existing works on this topic rely on the repetitive nature of impulse noise and use a large number of DMT symbols for estimation of the canceler and are therefore not suitable for handling transient noise events.

  abstract = {Suppose two finite signals are related by an unknown cyclic shift. Fast algorithms for finding such a shift or variants thereof are of great importance in a number of applications, e.g., localization and target tracking using acoustic sensors. The standard solution, solving shift finding by maximizing the cross-correlation between the two signals, may be rather efficiently computed using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Inspired by compressive sensing, faster algorithms have been recently proposed based on sparse FFTs. In this paper, we transform the shift finding problem into the spectral domain as well. As a first contribution, by combining the Fourier Shift Theorem with the Bézout Identity from elementary number theory, we obtain explicit formulas for the unknown shift parameter. This leads to linear time algorithms for shift finding in the noise-free setting. As a second contribution, we extend this result to the fast recovery of weighted sums of two shifts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel iterative algorithm for estimation of the unknown shift parameter for the case of noisy signals and provide a sufficient criterion for exact shift recovery. A slightly relaxed criterion leads to a linear time median algorithm in the noisy setting with high recovery rates even for low SNRs.},

Our treatment considers the limited cognitive effort exerted by a decision-maker and the effect of the observations along with their distributions on the stopping time and accuracy of the sequential test.

  pages = {418-422},
  abstract = {Currently, TV white space databases communicate the available channels over a reliable Internet connection to the secondary devices. For places where an Internet connection is not available, such as in developing countries, we propose a broadcast based geolocation database. This proposed geolocation database will broadcast the TV white space (or the primary services protection regions) on a rate-constrained channel. In this work, the feasibility of a broadcast based geolocation database transmission will be examined over rate constrained satellite channels. To address this problem, the quantization or digital representation of primary services protection regions is considered. Due to the quantization process, any point in the protection region must not be declared as white space region. Thus, this quantization problem is different than traditional quantizers which minimize the mean-squared error. A quantizer design algorithm is the main result of this work, which minimizes the TV white space area declared as protected region due to quantization. Performance results of our quantization algorithm on US and India UHF-band protection regions will be shown. The update-rate versus bandwidth tradeoff, while using satellite TV channels, for the proposed broadcast based geolocation database will also be explored in this work.},

Particular examples are approaches based on the delta-“function”.

The latter sense is in particular important for analyzing the frequency behaviour of that method - the aliasing error and the truncation error. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to construct a BLI without using the delta-“function”. This can in particular be done easily for the space of signals having integrable frequencies. If one consider another notion of band-limited functions, a BLI can even be given for the space of continuous signals “vanishing” at infinity. For the space of continuous signals, we answer the question whether there exists a BLI negatively.},

We first derive a multiplicative update rule for those problems by using the unified method developed by Yang and Oja. We next prove that a modified version of the update rule has the global convergence property in the sense of Zangwill under certain conditions. This result can be applied to many existing multiplicative update rules for NMF to guarantee their global convergence.},

To avoid the exponential growth of mixture components, a Gaussian mixture simplification algorithm is employed to reduce the number of mixture components, which leads to lower complexity in comparing with conventional resampling and clustering techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed BUKF-SGM can achieve better performance compared with the particle filter (PF)-based algorithms.

  abstract = {A crucial first step for signal processing decentralized sensor networks with node-specific interests is to agree upon a common unique labeling of all observed sources in the network. The knowledge “who observes what” is required, e.g. in node-specific audio or video signal enhancement to form node clusters of common interest. Recently proposed in-network distributed adaptive classification and labeling algorithms assume knowledge on the number of objects (clusters), which is not necessarily available in real-world applications. Thus, we consider the problem of estimating the number of data-clusters in the distributed adaptive network set-up. We propose two distributed adaptive cluster enumeration methods. They combine the diffusion principle, where the nodes share information within their local neighborhood only (without fusion center), with the X-means and the PG-means cluster enumeration. Performance is evaluated via simulations and the applicability of the methods is illustrated using a distributed camera network where moving objects appear and disappear from the Line-of-Sight (LOS) and the number of clusters becomes time-varying.},

  abstract = {Compressed Sensing (CS) has been successfully applied in a number of imaging systems since it can fundamentally increase frame rates and/or the resolution. In this paper, we apply CS to 3-D surface acquisition using Sheet-of-Light (SOL) scanning. The application of CS could potentially increase the speed of the measurement and/or enhance scan resolution with fewer measurements. To analyze the potential performance of a CS-SOL system, we formulate the estimation of the height profile of a target object as a compressive parameter estimation problem and investigate the achievable estimation accuracy in the presence of noise. In the context of compressed sensing, measurement models with AWGN are typically analyzed. However, in imaging applications there are multiple noise sources giving rise to different statistical noise models in which Poisson noise can be the dominating noise source. This is particularly true for photon-counting detectors that are used in low light settings. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the compressive parameter estimation problem in presence of Poisson distributed photon noise. The achievable estimation accuracy in obtaining height profiles from compressed observations is systematically analyzed with the help of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). This analysis allows us to compare different CS measurement strategies and quantify the parameter estimation accuracy as a function of system parameters such as the compression ratio, exposure time, image size, etc.},

We consider the classical mixed l2-l1 cost function, that employs an l2 representation error term and an l1 sparsity promoting regularizer. First, we observe that this cost function suffers from an inherent permutation ambiguity. This ambiguity may deteriorate significantly the performance of diffusion-based schemes, since the involved combination step may combine different atoms even when the same atoms exist at all dictionaries. Thus, we propose to align the dictionaries prior to the combination step. Furthermore, we define a new problem, that we call the node-specific distributed dictionary learning problem. The proposed Adapt-Align-Combine algorithm enjoys increased convergence rate as compared with a scheme that does not align the dictionaries prior to the combination.

The diversity extraction allows for the parties to reach decreased error probabilities by utilizing those extra resources of a multicarrier transmission that are not available in a single-carrier CVQKD setting. The additional resources of multicarrier CVQKD allow the achievement of significant performance improvements that are particularly crucial in an experimental scenario.},

Raman scattering, in particular, is shown to have detrimental effects on the performance of quantum key distribution systems. Here, by using a nearly optimal wavelength allocation technique, we minimize the Raman induced background noise on quantum channels, hence maximize the achievable secret key generation rate for quantum channels. It turns out the conventional solution that would involve splitting the spectrum into only two bands, one for quantum and one for classical channels, is only a suboptimal one. We show that, in our optimal arrangement, we might need several quantum and classical bands interspersed among each other.},

  abstract = {Our recent investigations of blind quantum source separation and process tomography methods for Heisenberg-coupled quantum bits (qubits) were focused on introducing a new separation principle, based on output disentanglement. We here extend them by proposing a more advanced implementation of their cost function and optimization algorithm. This leads us to move from a feedback to a feedforward adapting block, which avoids potential issues related to feedback in quantum circuits. The number of quantum source state preparations required to blindly adapt the separating system is thus strongly decreased (roughly from 107 to 104), yielding much faster adaptation.},

By sensing the scene at several wavelengths, we expect a more accurate target range estimation and a more efficient spectral analysis of the scene.

  pages = {518-522},
  abstract = {In the past years, many distributions have been proposed to model SAR images. In previous works, it has been shown that Mellin transform is a powerful tool to analyse random variable products: when speckle is modelled by a Gamma distribution, and when texture can be modelled by a “classical” distribution, Mellin convolution provides analytical expressions of SAR image distribution so that parameter estimations can be processed [13], [11]. In this paper we focus on the product of probability density functions, and more specifically on the Inverse Generalized Gaussian distribution [10]. This approach has been validated in SAR image processing by Frery et al. [7]. We show that the Mellin statistics framework can provide some enlightments about this probability density function family, and can clearly link the Mellin convolution pdf family and the product pdf family. Finally, it will be shown that the Meijer functions give a unified framework for many SAR distributions so that quantitative comparisons between pdf can be achieved.},

Most often, the partition is obtained by solving a combinatorial optimization problem, which is, in general, NP-hard. In this paper, we follow an alternative approach, using a Bayesian formulation based on a set of hidden real-valued random fields, which condition the partition. This formulation yields a continuous optimization problem, rather than a combinatorial one. In the supervised case, this problem is convex, and we tackle it with an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In the unsupervised and semi-supervised cases, the optimization problem is nonconvex, and we address it using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where the M-step is implemented via ADMM. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with experiments on simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {Modern signal processing methods rely strongly on Bayesian statistical models to solve challenging problems. This paper considers the objective comparison of two alternative Bayesian models, for scenarios with no ground truth available, and with a focus on model selection. Existing model selection approaches are generally difficult to apply to signal processing because they are unsuitable for models with priors that are improper or vaguely informative, and because of challenges related to high dimensionality. This paper presents a general methodology to perform model selection for models that are high-dimensional and that involve proper, improper, or vague priors. The approach is based on an additive mixture meta-model representation that encompasses both models and which concentrates on the model that fits the data best, and relies on proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to perform high-dimensional computations efficiently. The methodology is demonstrated on a series of experiments related to image resolution enhancement with a total-variation prior.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {533-537},
  abstract = {The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) consists in an electromagnetic signal which is transmitted at different positions through the ground in order to obtain an image of the subsoil. In particular, the GPR is used to detect buried objects like pipes. Their detection and localisation are intricate for three main reasons. First, the noise is important in the resulting image due to the presence of several rocks and/or layers. Second, the wave speed and the response of the pipe depend on the characteristics of the different layers. Finally, the signal attenuation could be important because of the depth of pipes. In this paper, we propose to derive an adaptive detector where the steering vector is parametrised by the wave speed in the ground and the noise follows a Spherically Invariant Random Vector (SIRV) distribution in order to obtain a robust detector. To estimate the covariance matrix, we propose to use robust maximum likelihood-type estimators called M-estimators. To handle the large size of data, we consider regularised versions of such M-estimators. Simulations will allow to estimate the relation Probability of False Alarm (PFA)-Threshold. Application on real datasets will show the relevancy of the proposed analysis for detecting buried objects like pipes.},

  abstract = {Positron emission tomography is more and more used in radiation oncology, since it conveys useful functional information about cancerous lesions. Its rather low spatial resolution, however, prevents accurate tumor delineation and heterogeneity assessment. Post-reconstruction deconvolution with the measured point-spread function can address this issue, provided it does not introduce undesired artifacts. These usually result from inappropriate regularization, which is either absent or making too strong assumptions about the structure of the signal. This paper proposes a deconvolution method that is based on inverse problem theory and involves a new regularization term that preserves local pixel value order relationships. Such regularization entails relatively mild constraints that are directly inferred from the observed data. This paper investigates the theoretical properties of the proposed regularization and describes its numerical implementation with a primal-dual algorithm. Preliminary experiments with synthetic images are presented to compare quantitatively and qualitatively the proposed method to other regularization schemes, like TV and TGV.},

Two main types of approaches have been proposed for image reconstruction either based on classical delay-and-sum (DAS) or on Fourier reconstruction. Using a single PW, these methods lead to a lower image quality than DAS with multi-focused beams. In this paper we review recent beamforming approaches based on sparse regularization methods. The imaging problem, either spatial-based (DAS) or Fourier-based, is formulated as a linear inverse problem and convex optimization algorithms coupled with sparsity priors are used to solve the ill-posed problem. We describe two applications of the framework namely the sparse inversion of the beamforming problem and the compressed beamforming in which the framework is combined with compressed sensing. Based on numerical simulations and experimental studies, we show the advantage of the proposed methods in terms of image quality compared to classical methods.},

Subband coefficients of typical images obey a certain structure, which can be viewed in terms of fixed groups (like wavelet trees) or statistically (certain configurations are more likely than others). Approaches using wavelet tree-sparsity have already demonstrated excellent performance in MRI. However, the use of statistical models for spatial clustering of the subband coefficients has not been studied well in CS-MRI yet, although the potentials of such an approach have been indicated. In this paper, we design a practical reconstruction algorithm as a variant of the proximal splitting methods, making use of a Markov Random Field prior model for spatial clustering of subband coefficients. The results for different undersampling patterns demonstrate an improved reconstruction performance compared to both standard CS-MRI methods and methods based on wavelet tree sparsity.},

  pages = {577-581},
  abstract = {The paper investigates the problem of maximizing the expected achievable sum rate in a fading multiple access cognitive radio network when secondary user (SU) transmitters have energy harvesting capability, and perform cooperative spectrum sensing. We formulate the problem as maximization of throughput of the cognitive multiple access network over a finite time horizon subject to a time averaged interference constraint at the primary user (PU) and almost sure energy causality constraints at the SUs. The problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program with respect to two decision variables, namely, spectrum access decision and spectrum sensing decision, and the continuous variables sensing time and transmission power. In general, this problem is known to be NP hard. For optimization over these two decision variables, we use an exhaustive search policy when the length of the time horizon is small, and a heuristic policy for longer horizons. For given values of the decision variables, the problem simplifies into a joint optimization on SU transmission power and sensing time, which is non-convex in nature. We present an analytic solution for the resulting optimization problem using an alternating convex optimization problem for non-causal channel state information and harvested energy information patterns at the SU base station (SBS) or fusion center (FC) and infinite battery capacity at the SU transmitters. We formulate the problem with causal information and finite battery capacity as a stochastic control problem and solve it using the technique of dynamic programming. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the various algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of sensor selection for the estimation of a stochastic source, being the sensor nodes powered by energy harvesting. Therefore, the interest lies in selecting the subset of most informative sensors that transmit their observations to a fusion center (FC). To that end, we propose to minimize the attained distortion at the FC plus a penalization term that promotes sparsity on the power allocation at the sensors. Then, we propose a decentralized algorithm in which the power allocation (and, thus, the selection policy) and distortion minimization problems can be regarded as separated problems. More specifically, the algorithm consists of: (i) a local computation of the power allocation policy, and (ii) a distortion minimization step. Moreover, for the case where sparsity is promoted via the classical ℓ1 norm, we show that the resulting local power allocation policy can be readily computed by means of a waterfilling-like algorithm.},

In this setting, users cooperate at the physical layer (data cooperation) in order to increase the achievable rates. Data cooperation comes at the expense of decoding costs: each user spends some amount of its harvested energy to decode the message of the other user, before forwarding both messages to the receiver. The decoding power spent is an increasing convex function of the incoming message rate. We characterize the optimal power scheduling policies that achieve the boundary of the maximum departure region subject to energy causality constraints and decoding costs by using a generalized water-filling algorithm.},

  abstract = {Energy Harvesting (EH) has been recognized as one of the most appealing solutions for extending the devices lifetime in wireless sensor networks. Despite the vast literature available about ambient EH, in the last few years Energy Transfer (ET) has been introduced as a new and promising paradigm. With ET, it becomes possible to actively control the energy source and thus improve the network performance. We focus on two particular applications of ET which have been studied separately in the literature so far: Energy Cooperation (EC) and Wireless Powered Communication Networks (WPCNs). In the first case, energy is wirelessly shared among terminal devices according to their requirements and energy availability, whereas, in a WPCN, energy can be purposely transferred from an energy-rich network node (e.g., an access point) to terminal devices. We solve a weighted throughput optimization problem for the two-node case using optimal as well as sub-optimal schemes. Numerically, we explain the role of EC in improving the system performance.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method for audio source separation. Additional constraints supporting e.g. temporal continuity or sparseness adapt NMF to the structure of audio signals even further. In this paper, we propose generalized NMF constraints which make use of prior information gathered for each component individually. In general, this information could be obtained blindly or by a training step. Here we make use of these novel constraints in an algorithm for informed audio source separation (ISS). ISS uses source separation to code audio objects by assisting a source separation step in the decoder with parameters extracted with knowledge of the sources in the encoder. In [1], a novel algorithm for ISS was proposed which makes use of an NMF step in the decoder. We show in experiments that the generalized constraints enhance the separation quality while keeping the additionally needed bit rate very low.},

When using spherical microphone arrays, it has been previously shown that Pseudo-intensity Vectors (PIV), and Augmented Intensity Vectors (AIV), are an effective approach for direction of arrival estimation of a sound source. In this paper, we evaluate AIV-based localization in acoustic scenarios involving multiple sound sources. Simulations are conducted where the number of sources, their angular separation and the reverberation time of the room are varied. The results indicate that AIV outperforms PIV and Steered Response Power (SRP) with an average accuracy between 5 and 10 degrees for sources with angular separation of 30 degrees or more. AIV also shows better robustness to reverberation time than PIV and SRP.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {607-611},
  abstract = {In recent years, voice conversion (VC) becomes a popular technique since it can be applied to various speech tasks. Most existing approaches on VC must use aligned speech pairs (parallel data) of the source speaker and the target speaker in training, which makes hard to handle it. Furthermore, VC methods proposed so far require to specify the source speaker in conversion stage, even though we just want to obtain the speech of the target speaker from the other speakers in many cases of VC. In this paper, we propose a VC method where it is not necessary to use any parallel data in the training, nor to specify the source speaker in the conversion. Our approach models a joint probability of acoustic, phonetic, and speaker features using a three-way restricted Boltzmann machine (3WRBM). Speaker-independent (SI) and speaker-dependent (SD) parameters in our model are simultaneously estimated under the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria using a speech set of multiple speakers. In conversion stage, phonetic features are at first estimated in a probabilistic manner given a speech of an arbitrary speaker, then a voice-converted speech is produced using the SD parameters of the target speaker. Our experimental results showed not only that our approach outperformed other non-parallel VC methods, but that the performance of the arbitrary-source VC was close to those of the traditional source-specified VC in our approach.},

The proposed solution is mainly developed for binaural hearing aid systems (HASs), where each hearing aid (HA) in the HAS has two microphones at a known distance from each other. However, the proposed algorithm can effortlessly be applied to acoustic sensor network applications. In contrast to most state-of-the-art calibration algorithms, which model the calibration problem as a non-linear problem resulting in high computational complexity, we model the calibration problem as a simple linear system of equations by utilizing a far-field assumption. The proposed model is based on target signals time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOAs) between the HAS microphones. Working with TDOAs avoids clock synchronization between sound sources and microphones, and target signals need not be known beforehand. To solve the calibration problem, we propose a least squares estimator which is simple and does not need any probabilistic assumptions about the observed signals.},

  abstract = {Modern applications embed complex mathematical processing based on composition of elementary functions. A good balance between approximation accuracy, and implementation cost, i.e. memory space requirement and computation time, is needed to design an efficient implementation. From this point of view, approaches working with polynomial approximation obtain results of a monitored accuracy with a moderate implementation cost. For software implementation in fixed-point processors, accurate results can be obtained if the segment on which the function is computed I is segmented accurately enough, to have an approximating polynomial on each segment. Non-uniform segmentation is required to limit the number of segments and then the implementation cost. The proposed recursive scheme exploits the trade-off between memory requirement and evaluation time. The method is illustrated with the function exp(-√(x)) on the segment [2-6; 25] and showed a mean speed-up ratio of 98.7 compared to the mathematical C standard library on the Digital Signal Processor C55x.},

It is mainly based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) characteristic of UWB channel impulse response, which allows for a sampling frequency much lower than the Nyquist limit. Since the UWB channel is rich in multipaths, the number of samples required results in an unrealistic number of processing channels. Our approach removes this drawback at the price of a moderate increase of the number of pilot pulses. Compared to other schemes presented in the literature, the one proposed in this paper allows reducing the number of processing channels to values appropriate for practical implementation. Moreover, the same approach is used to further reduce the sampling frequency at each channel. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel estimation in a coherent reception framework.},

Although several more sophisticated methods exist, thresholding is still the most used spike detection method. In general, it is employed by setting a TH as per convention or operator decision, and without considering either the undetected or spurious spikes. Here, we demonstrate with both simulations and real microelectrode measurement data that our method can fully automatically and objectively yield THs comparable to those set by an expert operator.

A recent work showed that instead of employing the usual Euclidean norm cost function for dictionary learning, better results can be achieved by learning the dictionaries in a robust fashion by employing an l1-norm cost function; this is because energy data is corrupted by large but sparse outliers. In this work we propose to improve the robust dictionary learning approach by imposing low-rank penalty on the learned coefficients.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these estimators by determining how user requests for video-from a video server-affects its usage. Relative Attribute Usage (RAU) estimators are designed by (1) formulating a generative model for the server attributes; (2) using the fact that the load signal has compact support compared to non-idealities in the server's behaviour in the time-frequency domain; and (3) using power-weighting to refine the estimates. The resulting estimators have low complexity. This motivates their candidacy when attribute usage estimates are required for run-time outage diagnosis routines, a task which is commonly referred to as “data-centre whispering”. We demonstrate the application of these estimators on a Cloud-testbed in three practical scenarios, when the server is under a (1) periodic, (2) step-increasing and (3) flash-crowd load.},

  pages = {697-701},
  abstract = {One of the main drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplex modulation is its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which can induce poor power efficiency at high power amplifier. Tone reservation (TR) is the most popular PAPR mitigation technique that uses a set of reserved tones to design peak cancelling signal for PAPR reduction. Finding an effective peak cancelling for PAPR reduction in the time domain by using only a small number of reserved tones, is not straightforward. Therefore, we are led to a trade-off between computational complexity and PAPR reduction. The TR method based on the gradient projection algorithm gives the best compromise. In this paper, we propose to modify the classical TR structure. The new proposed method achieves an improvement up to 1.2 dB in terms of PAPR performance without increasing the complexity. The effectiveness of this solution is confirmed through theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

The brain decoding paradigm is employed to classify recorded brain signals into two broad genre classes: Pop and Rock. We compare the performance of our proposed paradigm on two neuroimaging datasets that contains the electroencephalographic (EEG) and the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data of subjects who watched 40 music video clips.

Conventional BSI methods can perform poorly under these circumstances. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for multichannel BSI in under-modelled situations. Instead of minimizing the cross-relation error, a new optimization criterion is formulated, which is based on maximizing a cross-correlation criterion. We show that under the statistical model of reverberant signals, the cross-correlation based criterion helps to reduce the adverse effects of system under-modelling on BSI. Moreover, the optimization problem is regularized by including a sparsity term in the cost function. The optimization problem is finally solved based on the split Bregman method in the least-mean-square (LMS) framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method can perform effectively in the under-modelled situations in which conventional methods fail.},

  pages = {733-737},
  abstract = {It is well known that the time-of-flight ranging performance is heavy influenced by multipath propagation within a radio environment. This holds in particular in dense multipath channels as encountered in indoor scenarios. The signal bandwidth has a tremendous influence on this effect, as it determines whether the time resolution is sufficient to resolve the useful line-of-sight (LOS) signal component from interfering multipath. This paper employs a geometry-based stochastic channel model to analyze and characterize the ranging error variance as a function of the bandwidth, covering the narrowband up to the UWB regimes. The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for this purpose. It quantifies the impact of bandwidth, SNR, and parameters of the multipath radio channel and can thus be used as an effective and accurate channel model (e.g.) for the cross-layer optimization of positioning systems. Experimental data are analyzed to validate our theoretical results.},

The motion of multiple targets inside the area covered by a wireless network leaves a characteristic footprint on the radio-frequency (RF) field, and in turn affects both the average attenuation and the fluctuation of the received signal strength (RSS). A diffraction-based model is developed to describe the impact of multiple targets on the RSS field, i.e. the multi-body-induced shadowing. As a relevant case study, the model is tailored to predict the effects of two co-located targets on the RF signals.

  abstract = {Source localization of primary users (PUs) is a geolocation spectrum awareness feature that can be very useful in enhancing the functionality of cognitive radios (CRs). When the cooperating CRs have limited information about the PU, weighted centroid localization (WCL) based on received signal strength (RSS) measurements represents an attractive low-complexity solution. In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework to calculate the exact performance of WCL in the presence of shadowing, based on results of the ratio of two quadratic forms in normal variables. In particular, we derive an exact expression for the root mean square error (RMSE) of the two-dimensional location estimate. Numerical results confirm that the derived framework is able to predict the performance of WCL capturing all the essential aspects of propagation as well as CR network spatial topology.},

  pages = {748-752},
  abstract = {Recent results have revealed that MIMO channels at high carrier frequencies exhibit sparsity structure, i.e., a few dominant propagation paths. Also channel parameters, namely angular information and propagation delay can be modelled with the physical location of the transmitter, receiver and scatters. In this paper, we leverage these features into the development of a single base-station localization algorithm, and show that the location of an unknown device can be estimated with an accuracy below a meter based on pilot signalling with a OFDM transmission. The method relies on the utilization of the “Adaptive-LASSO” optimization method, in which an ℓ1-based minimization problem is solved by adapting the sparsifying matrix (dictionary) and the sparse vector jointly. Then the location of the device is estimated from the parameters of the sparsifying matrix. Finally, the positioning method is evaluated in different channel setting utilizing a ray-tracing channel model at 28GHz.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a solution adapted to Impulse Radio - Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) integrated receivers devoted to indoor localization, making usage of multipath information under imposed time resolution and low complexity constraints. The Multipath Components (MPCs) can ideally be tracked by capturing their space-time correlation under mobility. The proposed architecture is composed of Multiple Hypothesis Kalman Filters (MHKFs) in parallel, each filter tracking one single MPC while detecting measurement outliers or maneuvering paths. A data association procedure enables to map the MHKFs' outputs onto delays associated with receiver's energy bins. The relative temporal variations of MPCs are used to collectively infer the missing direct path's information in case of Non-Line of Sight (NLoS). The corrected observations finally feed a conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that estimates mobile's position. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme through realistic simulations in terms of both MPC and mobile tracking.},

  abstract = {Full duplex allows a device to transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band, theoretically doubling the throughput compared to traditional half duplex systems. However, several limitations restrict the promised full duplex gain: non-ideal self-interference cancellation, increased inter-cell interference and traffic constraints. In this paper, we first study the self-interference cancellation capabilities by using a real demonstrator. Results show that achieving ~110 dB of cancellation is already possible with the current available technology, thus providing the required level of isolation to build an operational full duplex node. Secondly, we investigate the inter-cell interference and traffic constraints impact on the full duplex performance in 5th generation systems. System level results show that both the traffic and the inter-cell interference can significantly reduce the potential gain of full duplex with respect to half duplex. However, for large traffic asymmetry, full duplex can boost the performance of the lightly loaded link.},

A novel digitally-controlled RF self-interference canceller structure is described, being able to process the signals in a frequency-selective manner as well as track adaptively the time-varying SI features, stemming from the fast digital control loop. A complete demonstrator board is developed, reported and measured, incorporating both the RF processing and the digital control processing.

  abstract = {This paper concerns the design of in-band full-duplex transceivers that employ generalized frequency-division multiplexing (GFDM). The composite of these two timely concepts is a promising candidate technology for emerging 5G systems since the GFDM waveform is advantageous to flexible spectrum use whereas full-duplex operation can significantly improve spectral efficiency. The main technical challenge in full-duplex transceivers at large is to mitigate their inherent self-interference due to simultaneous transmission and reception. In the case of GFDM that is non-orthogonal by design, interference cancellation becomes even more challenging since the interfering signal is subject to intricate coupling between all subchannels. Thus, we first develop a sophisticated frequency-domain cancellation architecture for removing all the self-interference components. Furthermore, by exploiting the specific structure of the interference pattern, we further modify the scheme into one that allows flexible control and reduction of computational complexity. Finally, our simulation results illustrate the trade-off between cancellation performance and system complexity, giving insights into the implementation of interference cancellation when we aim at achieving both low error rate and low complexity.},

The source is assumed to have multiple antennas, while the other three nodes are equipped with a single antenna each. Considering a simple time-switching design where power transfer and information transmission are separated in time. We investigate two popular transmission schemes, namely maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and transmit antenna selection (TAS). Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy outage probability of both schemes. In addition, simple approximations are obtained at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our results demonstrate that the more channel state information (CSI) available, the better the secrecy performance. For instance, with full CSI of the main channel, the system can achieve substantial secrecy diversity gain. On the other hand, without the CSI of the main channel, no diversity gain can be attained. Finally, our theoretical claims are validated by the numerical results.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology driving the 5G evolution. It relies on the use a large number of antennas at the base-station to improve network performance. The performance of massive MIMO systems is often limited by imperfect channel estimation because of pilot contamination. Recently, several channel estimation techniques have been proposed to minimize the performance degradation. However, the assessment of these techniques in the literature has often been conducted considering standard channel models, like the independent Rayleigh fading model and Clarke's multipath model, which do not consider spatial correlation. In this work, we investigate different channel models used and proposed for massive MIMO transmission and, through numerical studies, highlight their effect on the performance of the aforementioned channel estimation techniques. Based on this we recommend the use of channel models that capture the spatial correlation between antennas and different user channels.},

Users first harvest energy from the downlink WPT, and then use the harvested energy for uplink transmission. We adopt the downlink received signal power (DRSP) based user association to maximize the harvested energy, and address the impact of massive MIMO on the user association. By using new statistical properties, we then obtain the exact expressions for the average harvested energy and the average uplink achievable rate of a user in such networks. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that compared to deploying more small cells, the use of a large number of antennas is more appealing since it brings in significant increase in the harvested energy of the HetNets. In addition, results illustrate that serving more users in the massive MIMO aided macrocells decreases the harvested energy and the uplink achievable rate of the HetNets.},

The proposed scheme balances the tradeoff between pilot transmission overhead and channel estimation accuracy in scenarios with limited length of coherence time interval, and thereby the system performance is dramatically improved. In the proposed scheme, pilots are properly designed so that they can be transmitted simultaneously with data to decrease channel estimation overheads. By exploiting the asymptotic orthogonality of massive MIMO channels, the source data can be exactly detected from the received signal, and then pilot-data interference can be effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected data in the destination channel estimation. In the block-shifted transmission pattern, the effective data transmission period is extended to improve system throughput. Both theoretical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme to conventional ones in limited coherence time interval scenarios.},

  abstract = {In mobile communications, environmental noise often reduces the quality and intelligibility of speech. Problems caused by far-end noise, in the sending side of the communication channel, can be alleviated by using a noise reducing preprocessing stage before the encoder. In this study, a modification increasing the robustness of the encoder itself to background noise is proposed. Specifically, by using information already present in the encoder, the proposed method adjusts the perceptual weighting filter based on the characteristics of the noise to increase the prominence of the speech over the background noise. To evaluate the performance of the enhancement, the modification is implemented in the adaptive multi-rate wideband encoder and compared to the standard AMR-WB encoder in subjective tests. The results suggest that while the proposed modification increases the loudness of speech without affecting the quality significantly, for some female speakers the standard encoder is preferred over the enhancement.},

  abstract = {Independent vector analysis (IVA) can thoretically avoid the permutation problem in frequency domain blind source separation by using a multivariate source prior to retain the dependency between different frequency bins of each source. The performance of the IVA method is however very dependent upon the choice of source prior. Recently, a fixed combination of the original super Gaussian, previously used in the IVA method, and the Student's t distributions has been found to offer performance improvement; but due to the non-stationary nature of speech, this combination should adapt to the statistical properties of the measured speech mixtures. Therefore, in this work we propose a new energy driven mixed multivariate Student's t and super Gaussian source prior for the IVA algorithm. For further performance improvement, the clique based IVA method is used to exploit the strong dependency between neighbouring frequency components. This new algorithm is evaluated on mixtures formed from speech signals from the TIMIT dataset and real room impulse responses and performance improvement is demonstrated over the conventional IVA method with fixed source prior.},

Despite its effectiveness, this method will inevitably lead to over-smoothing due to choosing the mean of predictive distribution of Gaussian processes as optimal estimation. Thus, in this paper we focus on addressing the over-smoothing problem by post-filtering the outputs of the standard Gaussian processes, resulting in more dynamics in the converted feature parameters. Experiments have confirmed the validity of the proposed method both objectively and subjectively.},

Since in the case of such long missing parts entire words can be lost, we assume that the full text uttered in the speech signal is known. This leads to a new concept of text-informed speech inpainting. To solve this problem we propose a method that is based on synthesizing the missing speech by a speech synthesizer, on modifying its vocal characteristics via a voice conversion method, and on filling in the missing part with the resulting converted speech sample. We carried subjective listening tests to compare the proposed approach with two baseline methods.},

The proposed method is essentially based on two adaptive filters working in tandem. The weights between these two adaptive filters are exchanged by an efficient weight-transfer strategy, such that both adaptive filters give a good estimate of the acoustic feedback path.

  year = {2016},
  pages = {898-902},
  abstract = {Light Fields capturing all light rays at every point in space and in all directions contain very rich information about the scene. This rich description of the scene enables advanced image creation capabilities, such as re-focusing or extended depth of field from a single capture. But, it yields a very high volume of data which needs compression. This paper studies the impact of Light Fields compression on two key functionalities: refocusing and extended focus. The sub-aperture images forming the Light Field are compressed as a video sequence with HEVC. A focus stack and the scene depth map are computed from the compressed light field and are used to render an image with an extended depth of field (called the extended focus image). It has been first observed that the Light Field could be compressed with a factor up to 700 without significantly affecting the visual quality of both refocused and extended focus images. To further analyze the compression effect, a dedicated quality evaluation method based on contrast and gradient measurements is considered to differentiate the natural geometrical blur from the blur resulting from compression. As a second part of the experiments, it is shown that the texture distortion of the in-focus regions in the focus stacks is the main cause of the quality degradation in the extended focus and that the depth errors do not impact the extended focus quality unless the light field is significantly distorted with a compression ratio of around 2000:1.},

  pages = {903-907},
  abstract = {Given the widespread availability of point cloud data from consumer depth sensors, 3D point cloud segmentation becomes a promising building block for high level applications such as scene understanding and interaction analysis. It benefits from the richer information contained in real world 3D data compared to 2D images. This also implies that the classical color segmentation challenges have shifted to RGBD data, and new challenges have also emerged as the depth information is usually noisy, sparse and unorganized. Meanwhile, the lack of 3D point cloud ground truth labeling also limits the development and comparison among methods in 3D point cloud segmentation. In this paper, we present two contributions: a novel graph based point cloud segmentation method for RGBD stream data with interacting objects and a new ground truth labeling for a previously published data set [1]. This data set focuses on interaction (merge and split between `object' point clouds), which differentiates itself from the few existing labeled RGBD data sets which are more oriented to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) tasks. The proposed point cloud segmentation method is evaluated with the 3D point cloud ground truth labeling. Experiments show the promising result of our approach.},

  abstract = {Due to the resolution limitation of the hyperspectral imaging sensors, some targets only take one or two pixels in the hyperspectral image (HSI). These targets are called small targets. When HSI is impaired and has to be denoised, small targets might be suppressed in the denoising process, which can degrade the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the small target detection performance of HSI which is damaged by nonwhite thermal noise. One recently proposed nonwhite noise reduction algorithm prewhitening-multiway-Wiener-Filter (PMWF) and a usually used spatial-domain wavelet packet transform with SureShrinkage (SWPT-SURE) denoising approach are compared with the algorithm proposed in this paper. Finally, a real-world HYDICE HSI is employed to investigate the noise whitening capability and the improvement of small target detection performance.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a fixed-point local tone mapping operation (TMO) for high dynamic range (HDR) images. A TMO is classified in two types: local and global. Although a local TMO offers better results than global one, it requires more resources such as a computational cost and memory space. The proposed method uses fixed-point arithmetic with short data to solve this problem. The method uses an intermediate format which is composed of 8-bit mantissa part and 8-bit exponent part instead of IEEE754 standard floating-point format. Moreover, these mantissa part and exponent part are processed separately as two integer numbers. As a result, the method reduces the memory space. In addition, the method also reduces numerical range of calculations; it facilitates to implement the method with fixed-point arithmetic. The experimental results show that the method reduces the memory and computational costs, and offers high quality of tone mapped images comparable to the conventional method.},

The estimated model is then used to rectify images taken with the same camera. These methods generally use the fact that built environments are line dominated and these lines correspond to lines on the image when distortion is not present. The proposed method starts by detecting groups of lines whose real world correspondences are likely to be collinear. These line groups are rectified, then a novel error function is calculated to estimate the amount of remaining distortion. These steps are repeated iteratively until suitable distortion parameters are found. A feature selection method is used to eliminate the line groups that are not collinear in the real world. The method is demonstrated to successfully rectify real images of cluttered scenes in a fully automatic manner.},

The methods that perform tone mapping also known as tone mapping operators (TMOs) can be global and process all luminances in the same way, or they can be local and process the luminances with respect to their closer neighborhood. While the former tend to be faster, the latter are known to produce results of significantly higher quality. In this paper perceptually-based tone mapping is combined with one of the latest Retinex-based methods to create a high-quality TMO. The new TMO requires only a constant number of steps per pixel and experimental results show that it outperforms all but one state-of-the-art TMOs in terms of tone mapped LDR image quality.

Then, the proposed algorithm reconstructs the entire image from the selected partial pixels. In this algorithm, two types of sparsity are exploited. One is within each frame and the other is induced from the similarity between adjacent frames. The latter further means not only in the image domain but also in a sparsifying transformed domain. Since the cost function we define is convex, we can find the optimal solution using a convex optimization technique with small computational cost. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the standard approach for image completion by the nuclear norm minimization.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes an original prediction error expansion (PEE) reversible watermarking scheme that exploits the sign of the prediction error in order to prevent the overflow/underflow of the pixels close to the bounds of the graylevel range. More precisely, the pixels close to black are directly embedded by PEE when the prediction error is positive. Similarly, the ones close to white are embedded in case of negative errors. When the prediction error sign does not allow error expansion, an original solution is proposed. The pixel is left unchanged and one of its upper diagonal neighbors is embedded by PEE, but with a different prediction error. The diagonal neighbor is selected in order to prevent overflow/underflow. The proposed prediction error strategy ensures detection and reversibility without any additional information. The scheme is of interest for images with large areas of black and white pixels as, for instance, medical images.},

The proposed scheme is robust against a difference in compression levels, and does not produce false negative matches in any compression level. Existing conventional schemes having this property are not secure. To construct a secure identification system, we propose a novel identification system that consists of a new error correction technique and a fuzzy commitment scheme, which is a well-known biometric cryptosystem.

A nonlinear least squares (NLS) cost function is formed based on the observed signal and a parametric model of the signal, for a set of fundamental frequency candidates. For each of these, amplitude estimates are computed. The magnitudes of these estimates are quantized according to a codebook, and an updated cost function is used to estimate the fundamental frequencies of the sources.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel online method for analyzing acoustic scenes from sequentially obtained sounds. One prospective method for analyzing acoustic scenes is the use of a generative model of acoustic topics and event sequences in observed sounds, where the acoustic topic represents the latent structure of acoustic events associating an acoustic scene and acoustic events. This generative model is called an acoustic topic model (ATM). However, the conventional ATM employs a batch technique for estimating model parameters and cannot model sequentially obtained acoustic event sequences. Moreover, the number of classes of acoustic topics that lies in acoustic event sequences needs to be predetermined before observing acoustic events. However, the necessary number of acoustic topics for representing acoustic scenes varies in accordance with their contents, and this causes a mismatch between the actual number of classes of acoustic topics and the predetermined number of classes. In our method, the number of classes of acoustic topics can be automatically inferred from sequentially obtained acoustic event sequences on the basis of the online and nonparametric Bayesian technique. The experimental results of online acoustic scene estimation using real-life sounds indicated that the proposed method performed of acoustic scene classification better than the conventional ATM. In addition, the proposed method produced an efficient computation performance.},

They do so from a feature-based representation of the audio signal (e.g., MFCCs, chromagram), which is usually hand-designed for that specific application. In order to design a proper audio representation for MSA, we need to assess which musical properties are relevant for segmentation purposes (e.g., timbre, harmony); and we need to design signal processing strategies that can be used for capturing them. Deep learning techniques offer an alternative to this approach, as they are able to automatically find an abstract representation of the musical content. In this work we investigate their use in the task of Music Structural Analysis. In particular, we compare the performance of several state-of-the-art algorithms working with a collection of traditional descriptors and by descriptors that are extracted with a Deep Belief Network.},

  abstract = {Signals recorded by microphones form the basis for a wide range of audio signal processing systems. In some applications, such as humanoid robots, the microphones may be moving while recording the audio signals. A common practice is to assume that the microphone is stationary within a short time frame. Although this assumption may be reasonable under some conditions, there is currently no theoretical framework that predicts the level of signal distortion due to motion as a function of system parameters. This paper presents such a framework, for linear and circular microphone motion, providing upper bounds on the motion-induced distortion, and showing that the dependence of this upper bound on motion speed, signal frequency, and time-frame duration, is linear. A simulation study of a humanoid robot rotating its head while recording a speech signal validates the theoretical results.},

In this context, this paper addresses the determination of an admissible motion of a binaural head leading, on average, to the one-step-ahead most informative localization. To this aim, a constrained optimization problem is set up, which consists in maximizing the entropy of the next predicted measurement probability density function over a cylindric admissible set.

Although microphone arrays distributed on the long bodies of hose-shaped rescue robots are crucial for finding victims under collapsed buildings, human voices captured by a microphone array are contaminated by non-stationary actuator and friction noise. Standard blind source separation methods cannot be used because the relative microphone positions change over time and some of them are occasionally shaded by rubble. To solve these problems, we develop a Bayesian model that separates multichannel amplitude spectrograms into sparse and low-rank components (human voice and noise) without using phase information, which depends on the array layout. The voice level at each microphone is estimated in a time-varying manner for reducing the influence of the shaded microphones. Experiments using a 3-m hose-shaped robot with eight microphones show that our method outperforms conventional methods by the signal-to-noise ratio of 2.7 dB.},

To better cope with the situation, in this paper we propose to store solutions non-uniformly sampled from the parameter space to enable an iterative solver to quickly converge when being started from the closest initial solution. Efficient look-up of this closest solution is realized by using a k-d tree. The method is supported by a step to reduce the dimension of the parameter space and a linear extrapolation from the closest solution stored to the actually needed parameter vector.},

In this work we present a method for adapting instantaneous NonLinear (NL) bipoles characterized by monotonic increasing curves. The method relies on the fact that the characteristic of a NL bipole can be described by a line, which dynamically varies its slope and its intercept according to the actual operating point. This fact allows us to model a NL bipole as a linear real voltage generator with time-varying parameters. Dynamic adaptation makes possible to accommodate multiple nonlinearities in the same WD network, ensuring the absence of delay-free loops. We will show that diodes can be effectively modeled using the presented approach. As an example of application of our method, we present an implementation of a diode-based audio limiter.},

Digital implementations of saturating systems introduce harmonic distortion which, if untreated, gets reflected at the Nyquist limit and is mixed with the signal. This is called aliasing and is heard as a disturbance. A new correction function, derived by integrating the bandlimited ramp function, is presented. This function reduces the level of aliasing distortion seen at the output of soft clippers by quasi-bandlimiting the discontinuities introduced in the second derivative of the signal. The proposed method increases the quality of the signal by attenuating those aliased components that lie on the lower end of the spectrum, which are known to be perceptually important. The four-point version of the algorithm reduces aliasing at low frequencies by up to about 50 dB. This work extends our understanding of aliasing in nonlinear systems and provides a new tool for its suppression in virtual analog models.},

Although, carrier phase measurements are precise but they suffer from anomalies such as cycle slips and receiver clock jumps in addition to other error sources such as satellite-user dynamics and atmospheric delays. On one end, the detection and exclusion of these anomalies is critical for accurate and reliable positioning. On the other end, it is very difficult to detect these anomalies especially in dynamic environment due to irregular user dynamics. We propose a novel algorithm for separating and localizing these anomalies from the satellite-user dynamics. The proposed approach is based on extracting the singular spectrum of windowed carrier phase measurements. An optimal choice of different parameters ensures that the extracted singular spectrum is affected only by anomalies such as cycle slips and is independent of satellite-user dynamics. Simulation results, supported by real GNSS data analysis, indicate improved accuracy and enhanced robustness against such anomalies with respect to traditional approach using optimal time differencing.},

  abstract = {Using a sparsity promoting convex penalty function on high-order linear prediction coefficients and residuals has shown to result in improved modeling of speech and other signals as this addresses the inherent limitations of standard linear prediction methods. However, this new formulation is computationally more demanding which may limit its use, in particular for embedded signal processing. This paper analyzes the algorithmic and computational aspects of the matrix structures associated with an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for solving the convex high-order sparse linear prediction problem. The paper also analyzes the inherent trade-off between accuracy and the objective measure of prediction gain and shows that a few iterations are sufficient to achieve similar results as computationally more expensive interior-point methods.},

  abstract = {The traditional compressed sensing approach is naturally offline, in that it amounts to sparsely sampling and reconstructing a given dataset. Recently, an online algorithm for performing compressed sensing on streaming data was proposed: the scheme uses recursive sampling of the input stream and recursive decompression to accurately estimate stream entries from the acquired noisy measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel Newton-type forward-backward proximal method to recursively solve the regularized Least-Squares problem (LASSO) online. We establish global convergence of our method as well as a local quadratic convergence rate. Our simulations show a substantial speed-up over the state of the art which may render the proposed method suitable for applications with stringent real-time constraints.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the problem of multi-pitch estimation using sparse heuristics and convex modeling. In general, this is a difficult non-linear optimization problem, as the frequencies belonging to one pitch often overlap the frequencies belonging to other pitches, thereby causing ambiguity between pitches with similar frequency content. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the number of pitches is typically not known. In this work, we propose a sparse modeling framework using a generalized chroma representation in order to remove redundancy and lower the dictionary's block-coherency. The found chroma estimates are then used to solve a small convex problem, whereby spectral smoothness is enforced, resulting in the corresponding pitch estimates. Compared with previously published sparse approaches, the resulting algorithm reduces the computational complexity of each iteration, as well as speeding up the overall convergence.},

  abstract = {3D reconstruction has a wide variety of applications in computer graphics, robotics or digital cinema production, among others. With the rapid increase in computing power, it has become more feasible for the reconstruction algorithms to run online, even on mobile devices. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the adopted technique to deal with the sensor uncertainty. Most of the existing 3D reconstruction frameworks only recover the mean of the reconstructed geometry. Recovering also the variance is highly computationally intensive and is seldom performed. However, variance is the natural choice of estimate quality indicator. In this paper, the associated costs are analyzed and efficient but exact solutions to calculating partial matrix inverses are proposed, which apply to any general problem with many mutually independent variables. Speedups exceeding an order of magnitude are reported.},

The Frobenius norm of a general error matrix is minimized to find the best fitting PSDs. Experimental results show that the proposed estimator provides accurate estimates of the PSDs, and is outperforming competing estimators.

To reduce the mismatch problem, we propose a new method with two features. First, we introduce a deformation with an all-pole model that is optimized to make the trained basis fit the spectrogram of the target signal, even if the true target component is hidden in the observed mixture. Next, to avoid an excess deformation, we limit the degree of freedom in the deformation by performing discriminative training.

  abstract = {Affect bursts are short, isolated and non-verbal expressions of affect expressed vocally or facially. In this paper we present an attempt at synthesizing audio affect bursts on several levels of arousal. This work concerns 3 different types of affect bursts: disgust, startle and surprised expressions. Data are first gathered for each of these affect bursts at two different levels of arousal each. Then, each level of each emotion is modeled using Hidden Markov Models. A weighted linear interpolation technique is then used to obtain intermediate levels from these models. The obtained synthesized affect bursts are then evaluated in a perception test.},

We propose an adaptive distributed dictionary learning (ADDL) method where the dictionary learning problem is reformulated as a distributed learning task. With the help of this approach, we develop an automatic and robust method that effectively handles the complexity of the problem in terms of memory and computational cost and also obtains superior classification accuracy.},

In the second stage, the auxiliary variable is obtained by the one-dimensional line search. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Accordingly, the likelihood of observed mixtures of independent source signals is parametrized by the variances and the covariance matrices. The separation is performed by estimating the parameters and applying multichannel Wiener filtering. Assuming that spectral basis matrices trained on source power spectra are available, this work proposes a method to estimate the parameters by maximizing the likelihood using Expectation-Maximization.

The pitch of voiced speech frames is determined using a noise-robust pitch tracker and the speech level is estimated from the energy of the pitch harmonics using the harmonic summation principle. At low noise levels, the resultant active speech level estimate is combined with that from the standardized ITU-T P.56 algorithm to give a final composite estimate.

For this reason, we propose a median filter which smooths the probability distribution functions of degraded features, thus reducing the mismatch between training data and test. The new proposal uses a histogram mapping to obtain the PDFs (probability distribution functions) of each feature vector and applies a nonlinear median filtering before mapping to the reference PDF. The algorithm efficiency is analyzed and compared to a recently proposed linear mean filtering technique on the PDFs. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the histogram smoothing through the median nonlinear filtering reduces the mismatch between training data and test, improving the system performance under adverse conditions.},

Here, we investigated the effectiveness of spoofing attacks with statistical speech synthesis systems using limited amount of adaptation data and additive noise. Experiment results show that effective spoofing is possible using limited adaptation data. Moreover, the attacks get substantially more effective when noise is intentionally added to synthetic speech. Training the SV system with matched noise conditions does not alleviate the problem. We propose a synthetic speech detector (SSD) that uses session differences in i-vectors for counterspoofing. The proposed SSD had less than 0.5% total error rate in most cases for the matched noise conditions. For the mismatched noise conditions, missed detection rate further decreased but total error increased which indicates that some calibration is needed for mismatched noise conditions.},

Subsequently, the vectors of the feature sequence are reconstructed based on the learned dictionary and the probability of appearance of the dictionary atoms is estimated. The obtained probability serves to compute the value of a weight function for each frame of the recording. The histogram of this function is then used to estimate a binarization threshold that segments the recording into vocal and non-vocal segments.

ParSec addresses these subjects by investigating an innovative, CDMA based approach with very low latency of <; 50 μs, flexible resource block scheduling and BER of ≤ 10-9. While the latency figure is completely based on the assumption that a minimum of 3 symbol durations are needed the BER comes from the requirement specification. Two forms of FEC are used to achieve this requested figure. The radio will be used in the frequency range from 5,725 to 5,875 GHz and work without listen before talk. A rapid prototype has been built to conduct channel measurements and prove the promised properties of the PSSS255 approach.

  abstract = {Most existing methods in binaural sound source localization rely on some kind of aggregation of phase- and level-difference cues in the time-frequency plane. While different aggregation schemes exist, they are often heuristic and suffer in adverse noise conditions. In this paper, we introduce the rectified binaural ratio as a new feature for sound source localization. We show that for Gaussian-process point source signals corrupted by stationary Gaussian noise, this ratio follows a complex t-distribution with explicit parameters. This new formulation provides a principled and statistically sound way to aggregate binaural features in the presence of noise. We subsequently derive two simple and efficient methods for robust relative transfer function and time-delay estimation. Experiments on heavily corrupted simulated and speech signals demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme.},

The standard approach is to formulate the problem as a sparse recovery problem and solve it using ℓ1-minimization. As an alternative, the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm had been tested but resulted in pessimistic results. Our contribution is to successfully solve this problem using the AMP framework. Recently developed adaptive damping technique has been adopted to address the issue that AMP normally only works well with Gaussian matrices. Statistical models are designed to capture the nature of the signal more authentically. Expectation maximization (EM) method has been used to learn the unknown hyper-parameters of the statistical model in an online fashion. Simulations demonstrate that our method achieves better recognition performance than the impressive benchmark ℓ1-minimization, is robust to the initial values of hyper-parameters, and exhibits low computational cost.},

A common example is LASSO or Basis Pursuit where sparsity is enforced using an ℓ1-penalty together with a cost function ||y - Hx||22.

However, theoretical analysis of phase transition boundary of the correlated variables case lags behind that of uncorrelated variables.

However, there are many inaccurate image tags on the Internet, and it is very laborious to investigate the percentage of tags that are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a new method for creating an image recognition model that can be used even when the image data set includes many incorrect tags. Our method has two superior features. First, our method automatically measures the reliability of annotations and does not require any parameter adjustment for the percentage of error tags. This is a very important feature because we usually do not know how many errors are included in the database, especially in actual Internet environments. Second, our method iterates the error modification process. It begins with the modification of simple and obvious errors, gradually deals with much more difficult errors, and finally creates the high-performance recognition model with refined annotations. Using an object recognition image database with many annotation errors, our experiments showed that the proposed method successfully improved the image retrieval performance in approximately 90 percent of the image object categories.},

Compared with monocular vision systems, binocular vision systems (BVSs) have the advantage of dealing with illumination variation, shadow interference, and severe occlusion. Usually, the BVS constructs the world coordinates system by manually calibrating the ground plane. However, the camera vibrations decreases the calibration precision and weakens the system performance.

Local features (e.g., SIFT and HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-derived features, which have been used in semantic indexing, in general are extracted from the entire image and do not explicitly represent the information of meaningful objects that contributes to the determination of semantic categories. In this case, the background region, which does not contain the meaningful objects, is unduly considered, exerting a harmful effect on the indexing performance. In the present study, an attempt was made to suppress the undesirable effects derived from the redundant background information by incorporating object detection technology into semantic indexing. In the proposed method, a combination of the meaningful objects detected in the video frame image is represented as a feature vector for verification of semantic categories. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates the TRECVID semantic indexing task.},

Its scalable extension (SHVC) allows encoding simultaneously different versions of a video, organised in layers. Thanks to inter-layer predictions, SHVC provides bit-rate savings over an equivalent HEVC simulcast encoding. Therefore, SHVC seems a promising solution for both broadcast and storage purposes. This paper proposes a multi-layer architecture of a pipeline of software HEVC encoder to perform real-time UHD spatially-scalable SHVC encoding. Inter-layer predictions are furthermore implemented to provide bit-rate savings with a minimum impact on complexity. The proposed architecture provides a good trade-off between coding gains and coding speed achieving real-time performance for 1080p60 and 1600p30 sequences in 2× spatial scalability. Moreover, experimental results show more than a 1000× speed-up compared to the SHVC reference software (SHM) and an introduced delay only reaching 14% of the equivalent HEVC coding speed.},

Coupled tensor factorization aims to address this challenge by performing a simultaneous decomposition of different tensors. However, tensor factorization tends to suffer from a lack of robustness as the number of components affects the results to a large extent. In this work, a general framework for coupled tensor factorization is built to extract reliable components. Results from both individual and coupled decompositions are compared and divergence measures are used to adapt the number of components. It results in a joint decomposition method with (i) a variable number of components, (ii) shared and unshared components among tensors and (iii) robust components. Results on simulated data show a better modelling of the sources composing the datasets and an improved evaluation of the number of shared sources.},

These systems performance may be impaired when patient retina presents marks from previous laser photocoagulation treatments. Since these patients are already being treated, it is desirable to detect and remove them from the screening program.

Then, relative power carried in each scout at each instant has been used to create a neural information flow map. Another key feature of this paper lies in the fact that the database corresponded of subjects performing a group of tasks repetitively until significant drop in vigilance. This provides a unique point of view, as to how drop in vigilance levels affect the Neural Information flow. The results show a correlation between trends reflected in EEG parameters and performance scores of neuropsychological tests.},

  abstract = {A multilevel framework for the multiclass classification of spectra extracted from Fourier transform infrared images is described. This learning structure was employed to discriminate the spectra extracted from hyperspectral images of two batches of four different skin cultured cells (two normal and two tumor), where the cells of one batch had been stained with fluorescence live cell dyes. Different options were explored in each stage of the framework, specifically in the spectral pre-processing and the employed classification algorithm. Special care was taken to optimize the learning models and to objectively estimate the generalization performance by means of cross-validation. A very high discriminative performance was obtained for all the unstained skin cell types. However, the presence of the stains introduces spectral artifacts that worsen the class separation, as has been demonstrated in several classification experiments.},

  pages = {1333-1337},
  abstract = {An electrolarynx is a speaking aid device to artificially generate excitation sounds to help laryngectomees produce electrolaryngeal (EL) speech. Although EL speech is quite intelligible, its naturalness significantly suffers from the unnatural fundamental frequency (F0) patterns of the mechanical excitation sounds. To make it possible to produce more naturally sounding EL speech, we have proposed a method to automatically control F0 patterns of the excitation sounds generated from the electrolarynx based on the statistical F0 prediction, which predicts F0 patterns from the produced EL speech in real-time. In our previous work, we have developed a prototype system by implementing the proposed real-time prediction method in an actual, physical electrolarynx, and through the use of the prototype system, we have found that improvements of the naturalness of EL speech yielded by the prototype system tend to be lower than that yielded by the batch-type prediction. In this paper, we examine negative impacts caused by latency of the real-time prediction on the F0 prediction accuracy, and to alleviate them, we also propose two methods, 1) modeling of segmented continuous F0 (CF0) patterns and 2) prediction of forthcoming F0 values. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the conventional real-time prediction method needs a large delay to predict CF0 patterns and 2) the proposed methods have positive impacts on the real-time prediction.},

Our earlier vocoder [1], which applies continuous F0 in combination with Maximum Voiced Frequency (MVF), is extended. The focus of this paper is on the modeling of unvoiced consonants, for which two alternative methods are proposed. The first method applies no postprocessing during MVF estimation to reduce the unwanted voiced component of unvoiced speech sounds. The second separates voiced and unvoiced excitation based on the phonetic labels of the text to be synthesized. In an objective experiment we found that the first method produces unvoiced sounds that are closer to natural speech in terms of Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio. A subjective listening test showed that both methods are more natural than our baseline system, and the second method is significantly preferred.},

The acquisition rate is enhanced by partially collecting data in the kt-space. The combination of compressed sensing technique, along with homodyne reconstruction, enables the missing data to be recovered. The good reconstruction is guaranteed by an appropriate design of the sampling pattern. It is based on a pseudo-random Cartesian scheme, where each line is partially acquired for use of the homodyne reconstruction, and where the lines are pseudo-randomly sampled: central lines are constantly acquired and the sampling density decreases as the lines are far from the center. Application on real speech data show that the framework enables dynamic sequences of vocal tract images to be recovered at a framerate higher than 30 frames per second and with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. A method to extract articulatory data from contour identification is presented. It is intended, in fine, to be used for the creation of a large database of articulatory data.},

In our previous works, we derived closed-form solutions for TOA-based joint source and sensor localization and near-closed-form solutions for TOA information recovery in three-dimensional space (3D). Since the localization in 2D is simpler than that in 3D, closed-form solutions for both problems in 2D are derived in this paper.

ULS formulations are easily reformulated as Unit-modulus Quadratic Programs (UQPs), to which Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) can be applied, and is often the state-of-the-art approach. SDR has the drawback of squaring the number of variables, which lifts the problem to much higher dimension and renders SDR ill-suited for large-scale ULS/UQP. In this work, we propose first-order algorithms that meet or exceed SDR performance in terms of (approximately) solving ULS problems, and also exhibit much more favorable runtime performance relative to SDR. We specialize to phase-only beamformer design, which entails additional degrees of freedom that we point out and exploit in two custom algorithms that build upon the general first-order algorithm for ULS/UQP.

In this paper, the problem of optimal allocation of the computing power and of the corresponding data flows, according to bandwidth and computing capacity constraints, is modeled as a bilevel optimization program. It is shown that this program, which is generally non convex and hard to solve, has the same optimal solution of its convex relaxation. This allows to state a fundamental separation result, showing how the congestion control protocols employed in the network do not affect the optimal allocation problem, and allows to compute the shadow prices of the available computational resources.},

  abstract = {Widely linear (WL) receivers can fulfill single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) of one rectilinear (R) or quasi-rectilinear (QR) co-channel interference (CCI). The SAIC technology for QR signals has been shown to be less powerful than SAIC for R signals. To overcome this limitation, a SAIC/MAIC enhancement using three-inputs WL frequency-shift (FRESH) receiver has been introduced for QR signals. However, this receiver loses its efficiency for an interference having a residual frequency offset (FO) above a fraction of the baud rate. This may appear for airborne communications and it is the case for the inter-carrier interference of filter-bank based multicarrier waveforms using OQAM constellations which are candidate for 5G mobile networks. This paper extends the standard two-inputs SAIC/MAIC receiver and the three-inputs WL FRESH receiver for QR signals with FO. Analytical results and simulations are presented to study the impact of this FO on the performance of these receivers.},

To overcome this problem, we impose privacy-preserving restrictions, in order to constrain the cooperation among the nodes, and hence promote the privacy. To this end, the decentralized estimation of the network-wide correlation matrix is obtained via a novel adaptive matrix completion technique, where at each step, a rank-one completion problem is solved. Through simulation experiments it has been verified that proposed algorithm converges to the full rank correlation matrix. Moreover, the proposed algorithm exhibits significantly lower computational complexity than the conventional technique.},

Solutions to this problem require multivariate statistics approaches often focused on the reduction of the space dimension. In this paper we propose a fault detection and estimation approach using Multivariate Kullback-Leibler Divergence (MKLD) to cope with the negative effects due dimension reduction while using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The obtained results show its superiority on the usual PCA-KLD based approach. An analytical model of the MKLD is proposed and validated for low severity fault (incipient fault) detection and estimation in noisy environment operating conditions.},

Some of the households own renewable energy systems and energy storage systems (ESS) and sell the excess renewable energy to the residences that need electrical energy. The proposed strategy comprises methods that provide benefits for the residential electricity users and for the load aggregator. Specifically, we propose an off-line algorithm that schedules the renewable resources integration by trading energy between the renewable energy producers and buyers. Moreover, we propose a geometric programming based optimization method that uses the ESS for balancing the community's power grid load and for reducing the grid consumption cost. Simulations show that the proposed method may lead to a community's grid consumption cost reduction of 10.5%. It may also achieve balanced load profiles with peak to average ratio (PAR) close to unity, the average PAR reduction being 52%.},

  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple, unobtrusive and low-cost technique for measuring blood volume pulse (BVP) used in heart-rate (HR) estimation. However, PPG based heart-rate monitoring devices are often affected by motion artifacts in on-the-go scenarios, and can yield a noisy BVP signal reporting erroneous HR values. Recent studies have proposed spectral decomposition techniques (e.g. M-FOCUSS, Joint-Sparse-Spectrum) to reduce motion artifacts and increase HR estimation accuracy, but at the cost of high computational load. The singular-value-decomposition and recursive calculations present in these approaches are not feasible for the implementation in real-time continuous-monitoring scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient HR estimation method based on a combination of fast-ICA, RLS and BHW filter stages that avoids sparse signal reconstruction, while maintaining a high HR estimation accuracy. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the publicly available TROIKA data set both in terms of HR estimation accuracy (absolute error of 2.25 ± 1.93 bpm) and computational load.},

Motivated by this, we investigate herein a convex optimisation algorithmic structure, based on primal-dual forward-backward iterations, for solving the radio interferometric imaging problem. It can encompass any convex prior of interest. It allows for the distributed processing of the measured data and introduces further flexibility by employing a probabilistic approach for the selection of the data blocks used at a given iteration.

However, irrespective of the narrowband DOA estimation method used, many TF-points suffer from erroneous estimates due to noise and reverberation. We propose a novel technique to yield more accurate DOA estimates in the TF-domain, through statistical modeling of each TF-point with a complex Watson distribution. Then, instead of using the microphone array signals at a given TF-point to estimate the DOA, the maximum likelihood estimate of the mode vector of the distribution is used as input to the DOA estimation method. This approach results in more accurate DOA estimates and thus more accurate modeling of the acoustic environment, while it can be used with any narrowband DOA estimation method and microphone array geometry.},

One of these challenges is the spatio-spectral reconstruction of large (Terabytes) data cubes with high fidelity. This contribution proposes an alternative implementation of one such 3D prototype algorithm, MUFFIN (MUlti-Frequency image reconstruction For radio INterferometry), which combines spatial and spectral analysis priors. Using a recently proposed primal dual algorithm, this new version of MUFFIN allows a parallel implementation where computationally intensive steps are split by spectral channels. This parallelization allows to implement computationally demanding translation invariant wavelet transforms (IUWT), as opposed to the union of bases used previously. This alternative implementation is important as it opens the possibility of comparing these efficient dictionaries, and others, in spatio-spectral reconstruction.

This transform is adaptive to particle locations and in many cases leads to a parsimonious representation, so that the the joint likelihood values of all particles can be accurately approximated using only a few transform coefficients. The proposed particle filter uses gossip to perform distributed, approximate computation of the transform coefficients.

  abstract = {Diffusion adaptation (DA) algorithms allow a network of agents to collectively estimate a parameter vector, by jointly minimizing the sum of their local cost functions. This is achieved by interleaving local update steps with `diffusion' steps, where information is combined with their own neighbors. In this paper, we propose a novel class of nonlinear diffusion filters, based on the recently proposed spline adaptive filter (SAF). A SAF learns nonlinear models by local interpolating polynomials, with a small overhead with respect to linear filters. This arises from the fact that only a small subset of parameters of the nonlinear component are adapted at every time-instant. By applying ideas from the DA framework, in this paper we derive a diffused version of the SAF, denoted as D-SAF. Experimental evaluations show that the D-SAF is able to robustly learn the underlying nonlinear model, with a significant gain compared to a non-cooperative solution.},

  abstract = {Multifractal analysis (MF) is a widely used signal processing tool that enables the study of scale invariance models. Classical MF assumes homogeneous MF properties, which cannot always be guaranteed in practice. Yet, the local estimation of MF parameters has barely been considered due to the challenging statistical nature of MF processes (non-Gaussian, intricate dependence), requiring large sample sizes. This present work addresses this limitation and proposes a Bayesian estimator for local MF parameters of multivariate time series. The proposed Bayesian model builds on a recently introduced statistical model for leaders (i.e., specific multiresolution quantities designed for MF analysis purposes) that enabled the Bayesian estimation of MF parameters and extends it to multivariate non-overlapping time windows. It is formulated using spatially smoothing gamma Markov random field priors that counteract the large statistical variability of estimates for short time windows. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art estimators.},

Since the signals that are correlated across all data sets must be a subset of the signals that are correlated between any pair of data sets, we keep only the correlated signals for each pair of data sets. Then, a criterion inspired by a traditional information-theoretic criterion is applied to estimate the number of signals correlated across all data sets.

  abstract = {Snapshot imaging has a number of advantages in automated gel electrophoresis compared with the finish-line method in capillary electrophoresis, although at the expense of resolution. This paper presents a novel signal processing algorithm enabling a multi-capture imaging modality which improves resolution. The approach takes multiple snapshots as macromolecules are electrophoresed. Peaks from latter snapshots have higher resolution but poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while peaks from earlier snapshots have lower resolution but better SNR. Signals at different capture-times are related by a scale-in-separation, amplitude scaling, and an arbitrary shift. The multiple captures are realigned and fused together using least-squares estimation and a physically inspired signal model. Since partial waveforms are observed as the chromatic peaks exit the sensor's field-of-view, this is accounted for in the realignment algorithm. The proposed technique yields improved resolution, improved fragment concentration and size estimates, and allows the removal of static background noise.},

  abstract = {Recent achievements in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) demonstrated successfully a novel snapshot mosaic sensor architecture, enabling spectral imaging in a truly compact way. Integration of this new technology in handheld devices necessitates efficient compression of HSI data. However, due to the specific mosaic structure of the acquired images, traditional compression methods tailored to full-resolution HSI data cubes fail to exploit the special spatio-spectral interrelations among the pixels. This paper introduces an efficient and computationally tractable compression technique for mosaic HSI images. Specifically, an appropriate decorrelator is constructed for exploiting the spatio-spectral redundancies among the pixels, by modeling the filters arrangement on the mosaic HSI sensor as a multiple-input multiple-output antenna array. Doing so, the decorrelator depends only on the sensor and not on the data to be compressed. Comparison with state-of-the-art compression methods designed for HSI data cubes reveals that our approach achieves better reconstruction quality at lower bits-per-pixel rates.},

  abstract = {Binary descriptors have been very popular in recent years. One reason is that the algorithms that use them become computationally and memory-wise efficient. Furthermore, they tend to have some inherent robustness against some geometrical variations and against various brightness changes. These changes might result from both internal factors and external factors such as location of the light source, viewing angle, scene properties. In this paper, we describe a binary descriptor which proves to be robust to complex brightness changes such as gamma correction, noise and photometric distortions. The experimental results demonstrate that performance of the descriptor in object recognition and local image analysis tasks.},

In this paper, we derive a better metric (a best one under the condition) based on the approximation, and present an adaptive algorithm using the metric. Although the algorithm has quadratic complexity, we present its linear-complexity version based on a selective updating strategy. Numerical examples validate the approximation in a practical scenario, and show that the proposed metric yields fast convergence and tracking performance.},

Although it has been mathematically proven that the separation can be done when the mixture is linear, there is not any proof for the separability of nonlinearly mixed signals. Our contribution in this paper is performing nonlinear BSS for sparse sources. It is shown in this case, sources are separable even if the problem is under-determined (the number of observations is less than the number of source signals). However in the most general case (when the nonlinear mixing model can be of any kind and there is no side-information about that), an unknown nonlinear transformation of each source is reconstructed. It is shown why the problem reconstructing the exact sources is severely ill-posed and impossible to do without any other information.},

The secondary communication function is implemented by embedding one phase-shift keying (PSK) communication symbol in each orthogonal waveform, i.e., the number of embedded communication symbols during each radar pulse equals the number of transmit antennas. We show that the communication operation is transparent to the MIMO radar operation. The communication receiver detects the embedded PSK symbols using standard ratio testing. The achievable data rate is proportional to the pulse repetition frequency, the number of transmit elements, and the size of the PSK constellation. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated in terms of the symbol error rate. Simulations examples demonstrate that data rates in the range of several Mbps can be embedded and reliably detected.},

The obtained conditions allow us to relax the sparsity constraint of the sources to its maximum limit, with possibly overlapping sources. In particular, the W-disjoint orthogonality assumption of the sources can be discarded. Moreover, no assumption is done on the mixing system except invertibility. A differential evolution algorithm based on a smooth approximation of the ℓ0 pseudo-norm is used to illustrate the benefits brought by our contribution.},

  abstract = {In addition to interference and noise reduction, an important objective of binaural speech enhancement algorithms is the preservation of the binaural cues of both the target and the undesired sound sources. For directional sources, this can be achieved by preserving the relative transfer function (RTF). The recently proposed binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer preserves the RTF of the target, but typically distorts the RTF of the interfering sources. Recently, two extensions of the BMVDR beamformer were proposed preserving the RTFs of both the target and the interferer, namely, the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) and the BMVDR-RTF beamformers. In this paper, we generalize the BMVDR-RTF to trade off interference reduction and noise reduction. Three special cases of the proposed beamformer are examined, either maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Experimental validations in an office environment validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Source separation using an ad hoc microphone array can be useful for enhancing speech in such applications as teleconference systems without the need to prepare special devices. However, the positions of the sources (and the microphones when using an ad hoc microphone array) can change during recording, thus violating the commonly made assumption in many source separation algorithms that the mixing system is time-invariant. This paper proposes an extension of the multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approach to deal with the problem of underdetermined source separation in time-variant reverberant environments. The proposed method models the mixing system as a non-negative convolutive mixture based on the concept of a “semi-time-variant system” to handle the reverberation in a room as well allowing for relatively small changes in the source/microphone positions. It also models the power spectrogram of each sound source using the convolutive NMF model to consider the local dynamics of speech.},

  abstract = {In many spectral estimation and array processing problems, the process of finding estimates of model parameters often involves the optimisation of a cost function containing multiple peaks and dips. Such non-convex problems are hard to solve using traditional optimisation algorithms developed for convex problems, and computationally intensive grid searches are therefore often used instead. In this paper, we establish an analytical connection between the grid size and the parametrisation of the cost function so that the grid size can be selected as coarsely as possible to lower the computation time. Additionally, we show via three common examples how the grid size depends on parameters such as the number of data points or the number of sensors in DOA estimation. We also demonstrate that the computation time can potentially be lowered by several orders of magnitude by combining a coarse grid search with a local refinement step.},

  abstract = {In acoustic conditions with reverberation and coherent sources, various spatial filtering techniques, such as the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, require accurate estimates of the relative transfer functions (RTFs) between the sensors with respect to the desired speech source. However, the time-domain support of these RTFs may affect the estimation accuracy in several ways. First, short RTFs justify the multiplicative transfer function (MTF) assumption when the length of the signal time frames is limited. Second, they require fewer parameters to be estimated, hence reducing the effect of noise and model errors. In this paper, a spherical microphone array based framework for RTF estimation is presented, where the signals are transformed to the spherical harmonics (SH)-domain. The RTF time-domain supports are studied under different acoustic conditions, showing that SH-domain RTFs are shorter compared to conventional space-domain RTFs.},

In subsequent experiments, we compare combinations of both methods and evaluate their ability to retrieve the whole de-mixing transform.

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel method of horizontal plane Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) interpolation is proposed. As Interaural Time Difference (ITD) manifests itself as Interaural phase difference in spectral domain, linear phase constraints are imposed to compute the interpolated HRTFs. Hence the phase of the interpolated HRTF is constrained as a weighted linear combination of the phases of adjacent HRTFs. A weighted l2 norm error minimization is performed using these linear phase constraints. The performance of the proposed HRTF interpolation method is evaluated by computing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the interpolated HRTF and ground truth HRTF obtained from the CIPIC and SYMARE databases. Subjective evaluation is performed on the binaural audio that is rendered using interpolated HRTFs. It is noted from both RMSE and subjective evaluations that the proposed method performs reasonably better than the conventional HRTF interpolation methods.},

Until recently, this deconvolution process was realized independently voxel by voxel with a sole temporal regularization despite the knowledge that the ischemic lesion in acute stroke can reasonably be considered piecewise continuous. A new promising algorithm incorporating a spatial regularization to avoid spurious spatial artifacts and preserve the shape of the lesion was introduced [1]. So far, the optimization of the spatio-temporal regularization parameters of the deconvolution algorithm was supervised. In this communication, we evaluate the potential of the L-hypersurface method in selecting the spatio-temporal regularization parameters in an unsupervised way and discuss the possibility of automating this method. This is demonstrated quantitatively with an in silico approach using digital phantoms simulated with realistic lesion shapes.},

  abstract = {A new efficient and user-independent technique for the detection of muscle activation (MA) intervals is proposed based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Ant Colony Classifier (AntCC). First, time and frequency features are extracted from the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Then, GMM is used to cluster these extracted features into burst & non burst. Those features with their class name are then used as the input for the AntCC algorithm in order to derive classification rules. Finally, the obtained rules are used to detect sEMG activation timing of human skeletal muscles during movement. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by means of synthetic simulated sEMG signals and real ones. The proposed technique is then compared to two previously published techniques: wavelet transform-based method [1] & double threshold-based method [2]. It is concluded that our technique outperforms those methods and significantly improves the accuracy of good MA timing detection. Moreover, to our knowledge, the proposed technique is the first user-independent one since no tuning parameters are required. Our findings show that the proposed method is convenient for automatically processing large amounts of sEMG signals with performance beyond that of the state of the-art methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first hardware architecture for compressing and reconstructing correlated neural signals using structure-based inpainting. This novel methodology is especially important for the realization of implantable neural measurement systems (NMS), which are subject to strict constraints in terms of area and energy consumption. Such an implant only requires a defined controlling of the electrode activity to compress neural data. To achieve an efficient implementation with high throughput at the data recovery, approximately computation of arithmetic operations and elementary functions is proposed by using the logarithmic number system (LNS). Because of the digital quantization effects of the LNS conversions, an inherent thresholding operation arises. The proposed hardware realization significantly reduces the required iteration of inpainting computations. This inherent zero forcing in conjunction with the algorithmic error correction results in a speed-up in terms of neural signal recovery, which results in a throughput of 32 961 parallel reconstructions per second.},

  abstract = {Real-time industrial wireless systems sharing a crowded spectrum band require active coexistence management measures. Identification of wireless interference is a key issue for this purpose. We propose an efficient implementation of a wireless interference identification (WII) approach called neuro-fuzzy signal classifier (NFSC). The implementation in Matlab / SIMULINK is based upon the wideband software defined radio Ettus USRP N210. The implementation is evaluated in six selected heterogeneous and harsh industrial scenarios within the license-free 2.4-GHz-ISM radio band with variously combined standard wireless technologies IEEE 802.11g-based WLAN and Bluetooth. The evaluation of the NFSC was performed with a binary classification test with the statistical measurement metrics sensitivity and specificity.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {1743-1747},
  abstract = {Music source separation aims at decomposing music recordings into their constituent component signals. Many existing techniques are based on separating a time-frequency representation of the mixture signal by applying suitable modeling techniques in conjunction with generalized Wiener filtering. Recently, the term α-Wiener filtering was coined together with a theoretic foundation for the long-practiced use of magnitude spectrogram estimates in Wiener filtering. So far, optimal values for the magnitude exponent α have been empirically found in oracle experiments regarding the additivity of spectral magnitudes. In the first part of this paper, we extend these previous studies by examining further factors that affect the choice of α. In the second part, we investigate the role of α in Kernel Additive Modeling applied to Harmonic-Percussive Separation. Our results indicate that the parameter α may be understood as a kind of selectivity parameter, which should be chosen in a signal-adaptive fashion.},

In this paper, a method relying on the convex combination of two linear filters using the filtered-x LMS (FXLMS) algorithm and based on the virtual path concept to preprocess audio signals is presented for nonlinear room compensation. It is shown that the combination of two linear adaptive filters behaves similarly to the filtered-x second-order adaptive Volterra (NFXLMS) filter. Moreover the new approach is computationally more efficient and avoids the generation of higher harmonics. Experimental results validate the performance of the new approach.},

Such a model learns memoryless loudspeaker nonlinearities on a small temporal support of the echo path (preferably the direct-sound region) and extrapolates the nonlinearities for the entire echo path afterwards. In this contribution, an efficient frequency-domain realization of the significance-aware concept for nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is proposed. The proposed method exploits the benefits of partitioned-block frequency-domain adaptive filtering and will therefore be referred to as Partitioned-Block Significance-Aware Hammerstein Group Model (PBSA-HGM).

Using a perfect periodic sequence as input signal, an unknown nonlinear system can be efficiently identified with the cross-correlation method. Moreover, the basis functions that guarantee the most compact representation according to some information criterion can also be easily estimated. Perfect periodic sequences have already been developed for even mirror Fourier, Legendre and Chebyshev nonlinear filters. In this paper, we show they can be developed also for nonlinear Wiener filters. Their development is non-trivial and differs from that of the other nonlinear filters, since Wiener filters have orthogonal basis functions for white Gaussian input signals. Experimental results highlight the usefulness of the proposed perfect periodic sequences in comparison with the Gaussian input signals commonly used for Wiener filter identification.},

  abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) has been shown useful for reducing dimensionality, by exploiting signal sparsity inherent to specific domain representations of data. Traditional CS approaches represent the signal as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors from a prescribed dictionary. However, it is often impractical to presume accurate knowledge of the basis, which motivates data-driven dictionary learning. Moreover, in large-scale settings one may only afford to acquire quantized measurements, which may arrive sequentially in a streaming fashion. The present paper jointly learns the sparse signal representation and the unknown dictionary when only binary streaming measurements with possible misses are available. To this end, a novel efficient online estimator with closed-form sequential updates is put forth to recover the sparse representation, while refining the dictionary `on the fly'. Numerical tests on simulated and real data corroborate the efficacy of the novel approach.},

This research focuses to drive an optimal solution for UAV search and data gathering from all sensors installed in a crop field.

  abstract = {Mobile Cloud Computing refers to offloading computationally intensive algorithms from a mobile device to a cloud in order to save resources (time and energy) in the mobile device. But when the connection to the cloud is non-existent or limited, as in battle-space scenarios, exploiting neighbouring devices could be an alternative. In this paper we have developed a framework to offload computationally intensive algorithms to neighbours in order to minimise the algorithm completion time. We propose resource allocation algorithms to maximize the performance of these systems in real-time computer vision applications (drop less targets). Results show significant performance improvement at the cost of using some extra energy resource. Finally we define a new performance metric which also incorporates the energy consumed and is used to compare the offloading algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of a full-duplex (FD) physical-layer network coding (FD-PLNC) scheme using amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for a two-way relay channel (TWRC) network over reciprocal, asymmetric, and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, the proposed system is integrated with a self-interference cancellation (SIC) scheme to effectively reduce the self-interference (SI). Moreover, the impact of the residual SI on the performance of the proposed AF-FD-PLNC is examined. Closed-form expressions for the distribution of the end-to-end (E2E) signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and the outage probability are derived and presented. Furthermore, the analytical outage probability results are validated by simulation studies.

  abstract = {In this paper, the well-known forwarder's dilemma is generalized by accounting for the presence of link quality fluctuations; the forwarder's dilemma is a four-node interaction model with two source nodes and two destination nodes. It is known to be very useful to study ad hoc networks. To characterize the long-term utility region when the source nodes have to control their power with partial channel state information (CSI), we resort to a recent result in Shannon theory. It is shown how to exploit this theoretical result to find the long-term utility region and determine good power control policies. This region is of prime importance since it provides the best performance possible for a given knowledge at the nodes. Numerical results provide several new insights into the repeated forwarder's dilemma power control problem; for instance, the knowledge of global CSI only brings a marginal performance improvement with respect to the local CSI case.},

  abstract = {We consider Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks with multiple cellular users (CUs) and multi-pair direct D2D users (DUs). In this considered scenario, we propose a novel opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) scheme to improve the sum rate of the whole networks. DUs are opportunistically selected based on the reference signal space (RSS) of the CUs. According to the RSS, the DUs can calculate the scheduling metric which represents the strength of D2D interference to CUs. Then, we select the DUs according to the computing result. Unlike most of the existing methods, the proposed OIA scheme relies on the local channel state information, which is more realistic in practice. In addition, in view of the angle between the interference caused by each DU and the RSS, several scheduling strategies are designed to enhance the performance. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of the network.},

  abstract = {Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) may complement passive insulation of headphones by actively cancelling low frequency components of acoustical background noise. In systems with a single error microphone pointing towards the ear canal, a feedback controller performs the compensation task. We are focusing on fixed feedback controllers for broadband attenuation of arbitrary ambient noise. We use methods and optimization routines from control theory. In this discipline the key element is the so-called controller, which is in terms of signal processing a (digital) filter. The controller is designed by an optimization approach called the mixed-sensitivity H∞ synthesis, which requires an accurate estimate of the secondary path between the cancelling loudspeaker and the error microphone, and the knowledge of the secondary path uncertainties as well as a specification of the closed-loop sensitivity. The advantage of this method is the convenient formulation of performance and uncertainty requirements in the frequency domain. We describe the design process and evaluate the controller, which is realized in state space form, within a real-time system. The real-time measurements show a good match with the expected behavior. They furthermore confirm the feasibility of broadband attenuation by fixed i.e. time invariant feedback controllers in a digital system. The novelty of this contribution comprises of the specific design process of a discrete robust feedback controller for broadband noise reduction (roughly 250 Hz) and the digital real-time system implementation.},

  abstract = {Finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter is a commonly adopted signal processing unit in digital signal processing, due to its stability and easy implementation for linear phase response. To reduce the area complexity and power consumption of the filters, researchers have proposed algorithms to optimize the expression of coefficients with the reduced number of non-zero digits or power-of-two terms. This paper presents a new optimization algorithm based on elegant dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of non-zero digits in coefficient set, which yields to low logic operator cost in the filter circuit implementation. The proposed algorithm utilized the knapsack method from dynamic programming to effectively remove the redundant nonzero digits in the coefficients. Experiment results on benchmark filters show that the proposed algorithm can synthesize FIR filter coefficient with the reduced area complexity. Compared with two competing methods, the proposed algorithm can design FIR filters with an average of 14.49% to 47.73% reduced full adder cost over the competing methods.},

For this work it serves as a toy problem of a rapid digital design flow based on high-level synthesis (HLS). HLS facilitates extensive design space exploration in connection with a data type-agnostic programming methodology. Nonetheless, some algorithmic transformations are needed to obtain optimised digital architectures. OMP contains a least squares orthogonalisation step, yet its iterative selection strategy makes rank-1 updating possible. We furthermore propose to compute complex mathematical operations, e.g. the needed reciprocal square root operation, with the help of the logarithmic number system to optimise HLS results.

Additionally and to the best of our knowledge, we can report on the first complex-valued digital architecture of OMP, which is able to recover a vector of length 128 with 5 non-zero elements in 17.1 μs.},

Indeed, very few methods directly constrain the whiteness of the residual (the removed noise). We propose a new variational approach defining generic fidelity terms to locally control the residual distribution using the statistical moments and the correlation on patches. Using different regularizations such as TV or a nonlocal regularization, our approach achieves better performances than the L2 fidelity, with better texture and contrast preservation.},

Furthermore, being able to capture a large area with a single camera can be realized by using ultra-wide angle lenses, as employed in so-called fisheye cameras. However, the underlying non-perspective projection function of fisheye cameras introduces significant radial distortion, which is not considered by conventional super-resolution techniques. In this paper, we therefore propose the integration of a fisheye-adapted motion estimation approach that is based on a calibrated re-projection into a multi-image super-resolution framework. The proposed method is capable of taking the fisheye characteristics into account, thus improving the reconstruction quality. Simulation results show an average gain in luminance PSNR of up to 0.3 dB for upscaling factors of 2 and 4. Visual examples substantiate the objective results.},

  abstract = {Image retrieval in large image databases is an important problem that drives a number of applications. Yet the use of supervised approaches that address this problem has been limited due to the lack of large labeled datasets for training. Hence, in this paper we introduce two new datasets composed of images extracted from publicly available videos from the Cable News Network (CNN). The proposed datasets are particularly suited to supervised learning for image retrieval and are larger than any other existing dataset of a similar nature. The datasets are further provided with a set of pre-computed, state-of-the-art image feature vectors, as well as baseline results. In order to facilitate research in this important topic, we also detail a generic, supervised learning formulation for image retrieval and a related stochastic solver.},

Bin-Based Ontological Smoothing has been successfully used to improve language model performance in automatic speech recognition tasks. It uses ontologies to estimate novel utterances for a given language model. Since ontologies can be represented as graphs, we investigate the use of graph metrics as an additional smoothing factor in order to capture additional semantic or relational information found in ontologies. More specifically, we investigate the effect of HITS, PageRank, Modularity, and weighted degree, on performance. The entire power set of bins is evaluated. Our results show that the interpolation of the original bins at distances 1, 3 and 5 resulted in an improvement in WER of 0.71% relative over the interpolation of bins 1 to 5. Furthermore, modularity, PageRank and HITS show promise for further study.},

Overfitting occurs when the amount of training data is limited, leading to an over-sensible acoustic model. Multi-Task Learning is a method, among many other regularization methods, which decreases the overfitting impact by forcing the acoustic model to train jointly for multiple different, but related, tasks. In this paper, we consider speaker classification as an auxiliary task in order to improve the generalization abilities of the acoustic model, by training the model to recognize the speaker, or find the closest one inside the training set. We investigate this Multi-Task Learning setup on the TIMIT database, while the acoustic modeling is performed using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory cells.},

The resulting grating lobes (DOA ambiguities) were resolved using multiple carriers. One problem of MC-MIMO is the coupling of the unknown parameters range and DOA. In this contribution, we study this range-DOA coupling for MC-MIMO systems. We consider both Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of these parameters and their estimation. We show that a suitable choice of the coordinate system decouples range and DOA parameters in both CRB and estimation. This enables a sequential range and DOA estimation instead of a more complex joint estimation. Explanations of this phenomenon are given and simulation results confirm the theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method of rhythm transcription (i.e., automatic recognition of note values in music performance signals) based on a Bayesian music language model that describes the repetitive structure of musical notes. Conventionally, music language models for music transcription are trained with a dataset of musical pieces. Because typical musical pieces have repetitions consisting of a limited number of note patterns, better models fitting individual pieces could be obtained by inducing compact grammars. The main challenges are inducing appropriate grammar for a score that is observed indirectly through a performance and capturing incomplete repetitions, which can be represented as repetitions with modifications. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model in which the generation of a language model is described with a Dirichlet process and the production of musical notes is described with a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates the process of modifying note patterns. We derive an efficient algorithm based on Gibbs sampling for simultaneously inferring from a performance signal the score and the individual language model behind it. Evaluations showed that the proposed model outperformed previously studied HMM-based models.},

We introduce a DNN-based context clustering algorithm that implicitly divides the training data into several classes, and train them via a shared hidden layer-based MCL algorithm. Since the proposed MCL method efficiently models both the universal and class-dependent characteristics of various phonetic information, it not only avoids the model over-fitting problem but also reduces the over-smoothing effect.

However, segmenting noisy sclera areas in eye images under relaxed imaging constraints, such as different gaze directions, capturing on-the-move and at-a-distance, has not been extensively investigated. In our previous work, we proposed a novel method for sclera segmentation under unconstrained image conditions with a drawback being that the eye gaze direction is manually labeled for each image. Therefore, we propose a robust method for automatic eye corner and gaze detection. The proposed method involves two levels of eye corners verification to minimize eye corner point misclassification when noisy eye images are introduced. Moreover, gaze direction estimation is achieved through the pixel properties of the sclera area. Experimental results in on-the-move and at-a-distance contexts with multiple eye gaze directions using the UBIRIS.v2 database show a significant improvement in terms of accuracy and gaze detection rates.},

The resulting codec includes techniques for error robustness and a shaping of the coding noise. We present results of optimizing the codec parameters in our framework for global optimization based on psychoacoustic measures. Our evaluation shows that by using SLQ instead of scalar quantization a PEAQ ODG-score improvement with a maximum of about 1 point and a mean of 0.2 can be achieved. An analysis of the bit-error behavior of the combined SLQ-ADPCM shows that a major improvement in bit-error performance results from our proposed efficient error detection and processing.},

  abstract = {Three dimensional (3D) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is considered as one key technology for 5th Generation mobile communication systems. However, can the capacity derived from a 3D channel impulse response (CIR) better approximate the corresponding capacity derived from the measured CIR? Is there a substantial improvement in the capacity of 3D MIMO system in comparison to the classical 2D case? To answer these questions, extensive field measurements were conducted for the outdoor to indoor scenarios in China and New Zealand. Key channel parameters are extracted from the measured channel impulse response via the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, followed by the reconstruction of the 32 × 56 CIR according to 2D and 3D channel model. Then CIRs are used to evaluate the channel capacity and comparative simulation results demonstrate that the 3D MIMO capacity closely approximates the capacity predicted with practical CIRs. Moreover, obvious enhancements in the capacity of 3D channel is observed in comparison to 2D case. In addition, the distribution of eigenvalues and the number of contributing eigenvalues are also investigated.},

  title = {Full dimension MIMO for frequency division duplex under signaling and feedback constraints},
  year = {2016},
  pages = {1985-1989},
  abstract = {It is a open research problem of great interest how to fully utilize the benefits of massive MIMO original designed for Time Division Duplex (TDD) also in Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD). For efficient multi-user downlink transmission Channel State Information (CSI) has to be obtained at the receiver side and fed back to the transmitter. Due to signaling/pilot overhead scaling with the number of antennas and the feedback of the CSI the beamforming gain and spatial multiplexing gains of massive MIMO are limited. In this paper we present a novel scheme called User Non-aware Precoding and Effective Channel Estimation (UNP & ECE) for full dimension MIMO in FDD under signaling and feedback constraints. The idea is to construct a large codebook and distribute subsets of it on time-frequency resources as precoded pilots. The same precoders are also used for downlink transmission thus no additional demodulation reference signals are required. This limits the number of signaling overhead and a high quantization of the channel can be utilized. To limit the feedback we show that it is sufficient to report only the strongest stream index of a precoder subset for only a subset of Time Frequency (TF) resources. By sending just the index of the best stream the devices don't require knowledge of the applied precoders. This enables optimization of the codebook construction, the splitting in subsets, the distribution on the TF resources at the base station without awareness at the users.},

  abstract = {Massive MIMO has been identified as one of the key technologies for the 5th generation of mobile cellular networks. By utilizing 2D antenna arrays with a large number of antenna elements, it enables to form orthogonal beams towards spatially separated User Equipments (UEs). In this paper we evaluate the channel energy and the average throughput of typical indoor- and outdoor UEs at various heights and distances to the macro site. Our goal is to demonstrate the achievable spatial resolution of the beamforming in vertical direction with large antenna arrays. Existing work on directional beamforming strategies is commonly based on simplistic signal propagation assumptions under LOS conditions. This paper considers a realistic 3D channel model that also accounts for multi-path propagation under NLOS conditions. Our results exhibit the dependency of the achievable spatial resolution on both, the size of the antenna array as well as the channel conditions. They show that depending on whether the UE is located indoors or outdoors, the channel has an opposing impact on the achievable spatial resolution.},

  pages = {2000-2004},
  abstract = {Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a promising technology for the upcoming 5G as it provides significant beamforming gains and interference reduction capabilities due to the large number of antennas. However, massive MIMO is computationally demanding, as the high antenna count results in high-dimensional matrix operations when conventional MIMO processing is applied. In this paper, we focus on two-stage digital beamforming, where the beamformer is split into a slow-varying statistics-based outer beamformer and an inner beamformer accounting for fast channel variations. We formulate two two-stage precoding optimization problems: weighted sum-rate maximization and minimum user rate maximization for a single-cell downlink system. We also provide different heuristic methods of forming the outer precoder matrix via user channel covariance, while the inner precoder is obtained as a result for the optimization problem. Unlike most previous work, which consider the outer precoder design based on energy maximization and user group location, our aim is to design it to offer a tradeoff between energy maximization and interference reduction, and also take into account the fairness between users. We evaluate the performance of the different heuristic methods as a function of the number of statistical pre-beams and a fixed user angular spread to see the overall effect of complexity reduction on the system sum-rate and minimum user rate. We also evaluate the advantages of different methods in terms of user fairness.},

When multiple annotators provide their individual labels a more reliable collective decision is obtained if the individual reliability parameters are incorporated in the decision making procedure. The well-known Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule weights the individual labels in proportion to the annotators' reliability. In this work we analyze how the crowdsourcing system performance is degraded with the use of noisy annotators' reliability parameters and we derive an alternative MAP based rule to be applied when these parameters are neither known nor even estimated by the decision system.

  abstract = {A new method for the blind identification of large-scale finite impulse response (FIR) systems is presented. It exploits the fact that the system coefficients in large-scale problems often depend on much fewer parameters than the total number of entries in the coefficient vectors. We use low-rank models to compactly represent matricized versions of these compressible system coefficients. We show that blind system identification (BSI) then reduces to the computation of a structured tensor decomposition by using a deterministic tensorization technique called segmentation on the observed outputs. This careful exploitation of the low-rank structure enables the unique identification of both the system coefficients and the inputs. The approach does not require the input signals to be statistically independent.},

For this reason, there have been significant advances in automatic screening tools for early detection.

Using several color spaces and the Stochastic Watershed transformation, different characteristics of the optic nerve were analyzed in order to distinguish between a normal and a glaucomatous fundus. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on 53 images (24 normal and 29 glaucomatous images). The specificity and sensitivity obtained by the proposed algorithm are 0.81 and 0.87 using Luv color space, which means considerable performance in diagnosis systems.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {2060-2064},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a strategy to estimate a Fetal Electrocardiogram (FECG) subspace from a set of mixed ECG recordings from the thoracic and abdominal electrodes attached on a pregnant woman. The ECGs from an expectant woman contain FECG that can provide valuable information for fetal health monitoring, such as the fetal heart rate (FHR). After applying blind source separation (BSS) methods to mixed ECG, independent components are obtained. The main purpose of this paper is to classify an FECG group from all of these components which can be classified as FECG, MECG and noise according to the features of signals. Inspired by the concept of multidimensional independent component analysis (MICA) and to automate the classification task, we propose a procedure based on cyclostationarity of FECGs, in particular, an integrated Cyclic Coherence. The method is validated on real world DaISy dataset and the results are promising.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {2065-2069},
  abstract = {In this paper, the waveform design for transmit beampattern synthesis is studied in MIMO radar systems with colocated antennas. The waveform transmitted at each antenna is defined as a weighted sum of a set of discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences which have good orthogonal and band-limited properties. Assume that different transmit antennas use the same set of DPS sequences, while the weighting factors are variable which allows the correlation between different waveforms to be flexible and varied with the weighting factors. Optimum waveforms are designed to achieve a desired transmit beampattern under the constraint of a fixed total transmit energy. Unlike a traditional process, in which the waveform covariance matrix is designed in the first step and then the optimal waveforms are synthesised in the second step based on the designed waveform covariance matrix, it is shown in this work that the waveforms constructed by the DPS sequences need only one step to design the optimum waveforms. In this paper, we propose a new waveform design method for transmit beampattern synthesis which can efficiently match a desired transmit beampattern and control the power distributed at each beam in beampattern simultaneously. The choice of the number of the DPS sequences is also analyzed. Numerical simulations are provided to compare the performance of proposed method with that of the traditional methods.},

Because of communication constraints arising from distance and bandwidth constraints in a distributed UAV system, some UAVs may not be able to share their information with all other UAVs. This will lead to reduced tracking performance. In order to improve the estimation performance, a 3D distributed pseudolinear Kalman filter (DPLKF) using delayed information through intermediate UAVs is proposed. To track a moving target, a new estimation method using 1-step delayed information is developed which has low computational complexity. The communication topology with delayed information sharing is analyzed. In order to reduce communication traffic, a direct neighbors selection strategy is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy is demonstrated with simulation examples.},

This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression. The distribution of the test statistics is derived under both hypotheses, allowing the corresponding receiver operational characteristics (ROCs) to be computed.

  abstract = {A closed-form pseudolinear estimation algorithm for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) emitter localization was previously proposed by replacing TDOA hyperbolae with their asymptotes, effectively transforming the TDOA localization problem into a bearings-only localization problem. Despite having a good mean-square error (MSE) performance and low computational complexity, this algorithm was observed to suffer from systematic errors arising from the large misalignment between TDOA hyperbolae and asymptotes particularly in the near field and for poor geometries, resulting in increased estimation bias. To address the bias problem, this paper presents a systematic error correction technique based on a two-stage estimation process in which the estimation errors due to asymptote misalignment are computed from an initial location estimate and then subsequently corrected. The superior performance of the new algorithm compared with the maximum likelihood estimator is demonstrated with simulation examples.},

The resulting mean squared error expression depends on the observation period, the pulse period and the pulse duration. Analyzing the effect of these parameters shows that the mean squared error can be reduced (i) if the observation period is a multiple of the pulse period, (ii) if the pulse period is not a multiple of the sampling period, and (iii) if the total number of samples is a prime number.

  abstract = {Interest in risk measurement for spot price has increased since the worldwide deregulation and liberalization of electricity started in the early 90's. This paper is focused on quantifying risk for the Swedish spot price. Our analysis is based on a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) process with skewed exponential power innovations to model the stochastic component of the price. A Expected Shortfall (ES) backtesting procedure is presented and our model performance is compared to commonly used distributions in risk measurement. We show that the skewed exponential power distribution outperforms the competitors for the upside risk, which is of high interest as electricity spot prices are positively skewed.},

However, it is still a challenging problem due to the tremendous variations in illumination, clothing, color, scale, and pose. The aim of this paper to present our dynamic pedestrian detector. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection approach that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate pedestrian and non-pedestrian motion patterns. Although the CNN has good generalization performance, the CNN classifier is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture to reduce the time of feature extraction and training. Occlusion handling is one of the most important problem in pedestrian detection. For occlusion handling, we propose a method, which consists of extensive part detectors. The main advantage of our algorithm is that it can be trained on weakly labeled data, i.e. it does not require part annotations in the pedestrian bounding boxes.},

The Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition has proved to be a powerful tool to decompose a tensor data onto a few rank-one terms in a multilinear fashion. Here, we establish the connection between the CP decomposition and the SU problem when the tensor data is built by stacking small patches of the hyperspectral image.

The defining estimating equations depend on a differentiable convex loss function and choosing the LS-loss function yields the standard adaptive Lasso estimate and the associated scale statistic. An efficient algorithm, a generalization of the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm, is developed for computing the proposed M-Lasso estimates.

  abstract = {Many signal and image processing applications, including texture analysis, radar detection or EEG signal classification, require the computation of a centroid from a set of covariance matrices. The most popular approach consists in considering the center of mass. While efficient, this estimator is not robust to outliers arising from the inherent variability of the data or from faulty measurements. To overcome this, some authors have proposed to use the median as a more robust estimator. Here, we propose an estimator which takes advantage of both efficiency and robustness by combining the concepts of Riemannian center of mass and median. Based on the theory of M-estimators, this robust centroid estimator is issued from the so-called Huber's function. We present a gradient descent algorithm to estimate it. In addition, an experiment on both simulated and real data is carried out to evaluate the influence of outliers on the estimation and classification performances.},

  abstract = {Cognitive radar refers to an adaptive sensing system exhibiting high degree of waveform adaptivity and diversity enabled by intelligent processing and exploitation of information from the environment. The next generation of radar systems are characterized by their application to scenarios exhibiting non-stationary scenes as well as interference caused by use of shared spectrum. Cognitive radar systems, by their inherent adaptivity, seem to be the natural choice for such applications. However, adaptivity opens up reliability issues due to uncertainties induced in the information gathering and processing. This paper lists some of the reliability aspects foreseen for cognitive radar systems and motivates the need for waveform designs satisfying different metrics simultaneously towards enhancing the reliability. An iterative framework based on multi-objective optimization is proposed to provide Pareto-optimal waveform designs.},

  pages = {2230-2234},
  abstract = {The interference between automotive radar sensors becomes a major issue with the increasing number of radars integrated in vehicles for comfort and safety functions. The state-of-the-art radars, typically operating with frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) modulation, can be regarded as narrowband interferers for a high bandwidth orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar with comparably short duration of OFDM symbols. In this paper, we analyze the impact of such interferers on OFDM radar, give a signal model of OFDM radar in presence of interference and discuss the effect of signal processing steps on the latter. Additionally, we present an interference suppression algorithm suitable for any type of narrowband interference. We show in simulations that a considerable interference suppression can be achieved and verify the presented algorithm with measurements.},

Our waveform design scheme is conducted based on minimization of the integrated sidelobe level of designed waveforms, which is formulated as a quartic non-convex optimization problem. We start from simplifying the quartic optimization problem and then transform it into a quadratic form. By means of the majorization-minimization technique that seeks to find the solution of a corresponding quadratic optimization problem, we resolve the design of waveforms for MIMO radar.

  abstract = {The automated matching of mug-shot photographs with sketches drawn using eyewitness descriptions of criminals is a problem that has received much attention in recent years. However, most algorithms have been evaluated either on small datasets or using sketches that closely resemble the corresponding photos. In this paper, a method which extracts Multi-scale Local Binary Pattern (MLBP) descriptors from overlapping patches of log-Gabor-filtered images is used to obtain cross-modality templates for each photo and sketch. The Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) is then used for template matching. Log-Gabor filtering and MLBP provide global and local texture information, respectively, whose combination is shown to be beneficial for face photo-sketch recognition. Experimental results with a large database show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a Rank-1 retrieval rate of 81.4%. Fusion with the intra-modality approach Eigenpatches improves the Rank-1 rate to 85.5%.},

High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the successor of Advanced Video Coding (AVC), which is by far the most adopted standard worldwide. To promote the new standard, producers are re-releasing recent movies in HEVC format. In such a scenario, a fraudulent provider that does not own the original uncompressed data could sell old, lower quality AVC content re-encoded as if it were natively HEVC. Furthermore, with several hundred hours of video content uploaded every minute, it is not unlikely that re-edited low quality clips are labelled as HEVC to increase popularity and revenues from advertising. We tackle with these and similar issues by proposing a forensic technique to detect whether a HEVC sequence was obtained from an uncompressed sequence or by re-encoding an existing AVC sequence.},

In this work, we propose a novel and universally usable type of audio CAPTCHA that is solely based on the classification of acoustic sound events.

  abstract = {The possibility of studying multiple objects at once for forensic analysis has paved the way to the development of multimedia phylogeny algorithms. Concerning video phylogeny, a fundamental step at the base of many applications is multiple video alignment. This is, given a pool of near-duplicate video sequences partially overlapping in the temporal domain, find the relative time delay between all of them. As phylogeny methods typically takes into account huge quantities of data, the used alignment algorithms must be computationally efficient. In this paper, we propose a solution for multiple video alignment based on the minimisation of a least-square cost function. The proposed solution can be computed in closed form with reduced computational complexity. Moreover, we propose two possible solutions for refining the estimated alignment based on the removal of outlier measurements.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the use of biometric recognition systems in increasing number of applications with the number of users growing at a steady pace. However, security and privacy problems have arisen from this upsurge of interest to biometric systems. Template protection methods solve such security and privacy problems where unpredictability is a crucial goal. Here, we study the unpredictability of biohashing (a transformation-based template protection method) using entropy as a measure. Our novel work outlines a systematic approach for theoretical evaluation of biohashes using estimated entropy which is based on degree of freedom of Binomial distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that biohash unpredictability varies in different threat models where the entropy of a biohash is almost equal to its bit length under the naive scenario and is significantly low in the advanced scenario, implying that the amount of information kept hidden in a biohash is more likely to be predicted.},

Our approach exploits the underlying data distribution in a discriminant space in order to enhance SVMs generalization ability. We also extend this idea to the Least Squares SVM classifier, where the adoption of the intrinsic and penalty graphs acts as a regularizer incorporating discriminant information in the overall solution. Experiments on standard and recently introduced datasets verify our analysis since, in the cases where the classes forming the problem are not well discriminated in the original feature space, the exploitation of both intrinsic and penalty graphs enhances performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a statistical method of multichannel source separation, called NMF-LDA, that unifies nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in a hierarchical Bayesian manner. If the frequency components of sources are sparsely distributed, the source spectrograms can be considered to be disjoint with each other in most time-frequency bins. Under this assumption, LDA has been used for clustering time-frequency bins into individual sources using spatial information. A way to improve LDA-based source separation is to consider the empirical fact that source spectrograms tend to have low-rank structure. To leverage both the sparseness and low-rankness of source spectrograms, our method iterates an LDA-step (hard clustering of time-frequency bins) that gives deficient source spectrograms and an NMF-step (low-rank matrix approximation) that completes the deficient bins of those spectrograms. Experimental results showed the proposed method outperformed conventional methods.},

  abstract = {Detection of whispered speech in the presence of high levels of background noise has applications in fraudulent behaviour recognition. For instance, it can serve as an indicator of possible insider trading. We propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based whispering detection system, which operates on both magnitude and phase features, including the group delay feature from all-pole models (APGD). We show that the APGD feature outperforms the conventional ones. Trained and evaluated on the collected diverse dataset of whispered and normal speech with emulated phone line distortions and significant amounts of added background noise, the proposed system performs with accuracies as high as 91.8%.},

  abstract = {To emulate the human perception in quality assessment, an objective metric or assessment method is required, which is a challenging task. Moreover, assessing the quality of speech without any reference or the ground truth is altogether more difficult. In this paper, we propose a new non-intrusive speech quality assessment metric for objective evaluation of speech quality. The originality of proposed scheme lies in using deep autoencoder to extract low-dimensional features from a spectrum of the speech signal and finds a mapping between features and subjective scores using an artificial neural network (ANN). We have shown that autoencoder features capture noise information in a better way than state-of-the-art Filterbank Energies (FBEs). Quantification of our experimental results suggests that proposed metric gives more accurate and correlated scores than an existing benchmark for objective, non-intrusive quality assessment metric ITU-T P.563 standard.},

Though a lot of successful work was invested in expressiveness analysis and prediction, the results often involve manual labeling, or indirect prediction evaluation such as speech synthesis. The proposed analysis aims at direct acoustic feature prediction and comparison to original acoustic features from an audiobook. The audiobook is mapped in a semantic vector space. A set of acoustic features is extracted from the same utterances, involving iVectors trained on MFCC and F0 basis. Two regression models are trained with the semantic coordinates, DNNs and a baseline CART. Later, semantic and acoustic context features are combined for the prediction. The prediction is achieved successfully using the DNNs. A closer analysis shows that the prediction works best for larger utterances or utterances with specific contexts, and worst for general short utterances and proper names.},

These filters are universal approximators, according to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, and offer a remedy to the main drawback of their finite memory counterparts, that is the curse of dimensionality. Since recursive nonlinear filters become, in general, unstable for large input signals, we then consider a simple stabilization procedure by slightly modifying the input-output relationship of recursive functional link polynomial filters. The resulting filters are always stable and, even though no more universal approximators, still offer good modeling performance for nonlinear systems.},

An important step toward a cooperation between the nodes, e.g. for a voice-activity-detection, is a network-wide consensus on the source labelling such that all nodes assign the same unique label to each source. In this paper, a hierarchical approach is applied such that first a network clustering algorithm is performed and then in each sub-network, the energy signatures of the sources are estimated using a non-negative independent component analysis over the energy patterns observed by the different nodes. Finally the source labels are obtained by an iterative consensus and matching algorithm, which compares and matches the energy signatures estimated in different sub-networks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The inter-cell interference terms couple the maximization problems at the different base stations (BS)s. Large system approximations are used to replace the inter-cell interference terms and to decouple the problems. We demonstrate that the approximates depend only on the slow fading terms or second order statistics of the channels.

  abstract = {In full-duplex communications, existing digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) scheme cancels strong self-interference (SI) in digital domain. To sample the strong self-interference, a high-performance analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is adopted and leads to a high cost. To reduce the cost of the DSIC stage, this paper proposes a novel DSIC scheme, in which the reconstructed SI is converted to analog form and subtracted from the incoming signal before the ADC stage. Then the ADC samples only the weak user signal and doesn't require high performance. This paper analyzes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise power ratio achieved by the proposed DSIC scheme and derives the closed-form expression. In addition, comparisons show that the proposed DSIC scheme is far more cost-effective than existing DSIC scheme. At the end, various simulations verify the ability of the proposed DSIC scheme to reduce the cost.},

We can achieve C-times the sampling rate of a single ADC if all the shifts between the channels are identical. In practice, however, it is not possible to avoid mismatch among shifts. Besides, the samples are also subject to jitter noise. In this paper, we propose a blind method to mitigate the joint effects of sampling jitter and shift mismatch in the TI-ADC structure. We assume the input signal to be bandlimited and incorporate the jitter via a stochastic model. Next, we derive an approximate model based on a first-order Taylor series and use an iterative maximum likelihood estimator to reconstruct the uniform samples of the input signal. The simulation results show that with a slight increase in the mean square-error, we obtain a fast blind compensation algorithm.},

The method assumes a smooth evolution of a succession of continuous signals that can have a numerical or an analytical expression with respect to some parameters. The Bayesian model proposed takes into account the Gaussian properties of the noise and the smooth evolution of the successive signals. In addition, a gamma Markov random field prior is assigned to the signal energies and to the noise variances to account for their known properties. The resulting posterior distribution is maximized using a fast coordinate descent algorithm whose parameters are updated by analytical expressions. The proposed algorithm is tested on satellite altimetric data demonstrating good denoising results on both synthetic and real signals.

  year = {2016},
  pages = {2390-2394},
  abstract = {In communication systems, clean speech is often reproduced by loudspeakers and disturbed by local acoustical noise. Near-end listening enhancement (NELE) is a technique to enhance the speech intelligibility in environmental noise by adaptively preprocessing the speech based on a noise estimate. Conventional NELE-algorithms adaptively filter the speech by applying spectral gains which are determined by maximizing intelligibility measures. Usually, this leads to speech amplifications at highly disturbed frequencies to overcome masking. In this paper, a new approach is presented which shapes the speech spectrum according to the inverse of the noise power spectrum. It is based on a simple gain rule. Its advantages are a predictable spectral behavior and a fixed computational complexity, since no optimization problem with an unknown number of iterations needs to be solved. Simulations have shown that it copes with a wide range of noise types and provides a similar performance compared to conventional algorithms.},

  abstract = {In order to improve asset knowledge and avoid third part damages during road works, the localization of gas pipes in a non-destructive way has become a wide domain of research during these last years. Several devices have been developed in order to answer this problem. Acoustic, electromagnetic or RFID technologies are used to find pipes in the underground. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is also used to detect buried gas pipes. However it does not directly provide a 3D position but a reflection map called B-scan that the user must interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically get the position of gas pipes with GPR acquisitions. This method uses a dictionary of theoretical pipe signatures. The correlation between each atom from the dictionary and the B-scan is used as feature in a two part supervised learning scheme. Our method has been applied to real data acquired on a test area and in real condition. The proposed method presents satisfying qualitative and quantitative results compared to other methods.},

  abstract = {Distance estimation for marine vessels is of vital importance to unmanned ship vehicles (USVs) for navigation and collision prevention. This can be achieved by means such as radar or laser sighting. However, due to constraints of the USV, it may be desired to estimate distance using a monocular camera. In this paper, we propose a method that, given a video of a marine vehicle in a maritime environment and a tracker, estimates the distance of the tracked vehicle from the camera. The method detects the horizon and uses its distance as a reference. It detects the contact point of the vehicle with the sea surface by finding a maximally stable extremal region (MSER). Then, it relies on geometries of the earth and on optical properties of the camera to compute the distance. The method was tested on video footage of several sea maneuvers with an average error of 7.1%.},

The method is based on an auto-regressive modeling (AR) of QRS complexes. Each heartbeat is characterized by its AR coefficients. Then, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier uses the AR coefficients to discriminate between N beats and VEB. In addition, the use of AR modeling prediction error en as a discriminating feature is investigated. Results show that the prediction error power (σ2p) enhances significantly the classification accuracy. The proposed classifier is compared to a classifier based on the use of RR timing information. Finally, the two classifiers are combined together where the classification result is given by the agreement of the two classifiers. The proposed AR modeling approach performs better than the RR interval-based classifier and their combination enhances the classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {Wave Field Synthesis aims at the accurate reproduction of a sound field inside an extended listening area which is surrounded by individually driven loudspeakers. Recently a Local Wave Field Synthesis technique has been published which utilizes focused sources as a distribution of virtual loudspeakers in order to increase the reproduction accuracy in a particular local region. Similar to conventional Wave Field Synthesis, this technique relies heavily on delaying and weighting the input signals of the virtual sound sources. As these delays are in general not an integer multiple of the input signals' sample rate, delay interpolation is necessary. This paper analyses in how far the accuracy of the delay interpolation influences the spectral properties of the synthesised sound field. The results show, that an upsampling of the virtual source's input signal is an computationally efficient tool which leads to a significant increase of accuracy.},

While depth has been mainly used for processing keypoint descriptors, in this paper we focus on the keypoint detection problem. In order to produce a computationally efficient viewpoint-covariant multiscale representation, we design an image smoothing procedure which locally smooths a texture image based on the corresponding depth. This yields an approximated scale space, where we can find keypoints using a multiscale detector approach. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world images show substantial gains with respect to 2D and other RGBD feature extraction approaches.},

  abstract = {Image inpainting is the process of filling missing or fixing corrupted regions in a given image. The intensity values of the pixels in missing area are expected to be associated with the pixels in the surrounding area. Interpolation-based methods that can solve the problem with a high accuracy may become inefficient when the dimension of the data increases. We solve this problem by representing images with lower dimensions using High Dimensional Model Representation method. We then perform Lagrange interpolation on the lower dimensional data to find the intensity values of the missing pixels. In order to use High Dimensional Model Representation method and to improve the accuracy of Lagrange interpolation, we also propose a procedure that decompose missing regions into smaller ones and perform inpainting hierarchically starting from the smallest region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces better results than the variational and exemplar-based inpainting approaches in most of the test images.},

  abstract = {Fast and robust ellipse detection is a vital step in many image processing and computer vision applications. Two main approaches exist for ellipse detection, i.e., model-based and feature-based. Model-based methods require much more computation, but they can perform better in occlusions. Feature-based approaches are fast but may perform insufficient in cluttered cases. In this study, we propose an hybrid method which combines both approaches to accelerate the process without compromising accuracy. We extract elliptical arcs to narrow down search space by obtaining seeds for prospective ellipses. For each seed arc, we compute a limited search region consisting of hypothetical ellipses that each can be formed with that seed. Later, we vote them on the edge image to determine best hypothesis among the all, if exists. We tested the proposed algorithm on a public dataset and promising results are obtained compare to state of the art methods in the literature.},

  abstract = {It is desirable to support efficient lossless coding within video coding standards, which are primarily designed for lossy coding, with as little modification as possible. A simple approach is to skip transform and quantization, and directly entropy code the prediction residual, but this is inefficient for compression. A more efficient and popular approach is to process the residual block with DPCM prior to entropy coding. This paper explores an alternative approach based on processing the residual block with integer-to-integer (i2i) transforms. I2i transforms map integers to integers, however, unlike the integer transforms used in HEVC for lossy coding, they do not increase the dynamic range at the output and can be used in lossless coding. We focus on lossless intra coding and use both an i2i DCT from the literature and a novel i2i approximation of the odd type-3 DST. Experiments with the HEVC reference software show improved results.},
