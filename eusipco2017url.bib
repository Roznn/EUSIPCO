  abstract = {Binaural beamformers (BFs) aim to reduce the output noise power while simultaneously preserving the binaural cues of all sources. Typically, the latter is accomplished via constraints relating the output and input interaural transfer functions (ITFs). The ITF is a function of the corresponding relative acoustic transfer function (RATF), which implies that RATF estimates of all sources in the acoustic scene are required. Here, we propose an alternative way to approximately preserve the binaural cues of the entire acoustic scene without estimating RATFs. We propose to preserve the binaural cues of all sources with a set of fixed pre-determined RATFs distributed around the head. Two recently proposed binaural BFs are evaluated in the context of using pre-determined RATFs and compared to the binaural minimum variance distrortionless response BF which can only preserve the binaural cues of the target.},

  abstract = {The capability of modern hearing aids to provide hearing-impaired humans with enhanced signals, which ultimately leads to an increased speech intelligibility, may benefit from fitting the device for each subject individually. This ideally also involves the exploitation of Head-Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs). However, HRIRs vary from person to person and thus require tedious measurements for each individual. In this work, we investigate two approaches which aim at speeding up the HRIR acquisition procedure. These are continuous measurements and interpolation, where Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as well as linear interpolation of the magnitude and phase responses are considered. In contrast to related publications, the continuous HRIR measurements are not performed in anechoic environments here. The quality of the obtained HRIRs is assessed by means of the system mismatch and the proposed error of relative transfer functions. Both measures reveal that continuous HRIR measurements are on average much more capable than the investigated interpolation approaches, and they furthermore provide a more uniform performance for different source directions.},

While most probabilistic techniques presented in the past rely on Gaussian models, we go further in this direction and detail a method for source localization that is based on the recently proposed α-stable harmonizable processes. They include Cauchy and Gaussian as special cases and their remarkable feature is to allow a simple modeling of impulsive and real world sounds with few parameters. The approach we present builds on the classical convolutive mixing model and has the particularities of requiring going through the data only once, to also work in the underdetermined case of more sources than microphones and to allow massively parallelizable implementations operating in the time-frequency domain. We show that the method yields interesting performance for acoustic imaging in realistic simulations.},

  abstract = {Hand gestures are tools for conveying information, expressing emotion, interacting with electronic devices or even serving disabled people as a second language. A gesture can be recognized by capturing the movement of the hand, in real time, and classifying the collected data. Several commercial products such as Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion Sensor, Synertial Gloves and HTC Vive have been released and new solutions have been proposed by researchers to handle this task. These systems are mainly based on optical measurements, inertial measurements, ultrasound signals and radio signals. This paper proposes an ultrasonic-based gesture recognition system using AOA (Angle of Arrival) information of ultrasonic signals emitted from a wearable ultrasound transducer. The 2-D angles of the moving hand are estimated using multi-frequency signals captured by a fixed receiver array. A simple redundant dictionary matching classifier is designed to recognize gestures representing the numbers from `0' to `9' and compared with a neural network classifier. Average classification accuracies of 95.5% and 94.4% are obtained, respectively, using the two classification methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the binaural noise-reduction problem using an array of microphones. The widely linear (WL) framework in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain is adopted. In such a framework, the microphone array signals and binaural outputs are first merged into complex signals. These complex signals are subsequently transformed into the STFT domain. The WL estimation theory is then applied in STFT subbands with interband correlation to form the optimal WL Wiener filter, which exploits the noncircular properties of the input complex signals to achieve noise reduction and meanwhile to preserve the sound spatial realism. Finally, the time-domain binaural output is reconstructed from the output of the WL Wiener filter using the inverse STFT. The effectiveness of the developed STFT-domain WL Wiener filter for binaural noise reduction is justified using experiments.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) has gained wide interest in brain research, thanks to the highly complementary spatiotemporal nature of both modalities. We propose a novel technique to extract sources of neural activity from the multimodal measurements, which relies on a structured form of coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF). In a data-symmetric fashion, we characterize these underlying sources in the spatial, temporal and spectral domain, and estimate how the observations in EEG and fMRI are related through neurovascular coupling. That is, we explicitly account for the intrinsically variable nature of this coupling, allowing more accurate localization of the neural activity in time and space. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, which is shown to be robust to noise, by means of a simulation study. Hence, this provides a conceptually simple, yet effective alternative to other data-driven analysis methods in event-related or resting-state EEG-fMRI studies.},

The proposed algorithm is less influenced by noise and outliers and is capable of segmenting gait cycles from different types of gait signals recorded using different sensor systems. The presented algorithm has enhanced ability to segment gait cycles by eliminating the false peaks and interpolating the missing peaks. The variance of segmented cycles' lengths is computed as a criterion for evaluating the performance of segmentation. The proposed algorithm is tested on gait signals of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease collected from three databases. The segmentation results on three types of gait signals demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to segment gait cycles accurately, and have achieved better performance than the original peak detection methods.},

  abstract = {We consider the task of automatically predicting spirometry readings from cough and wheeze audio signals for asthma severity monitoring. Spirometry is a pulmonary function test used to measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) when a subject exhales in the spirometry sensor after taking a deep breath. FEV1%, FVC% and their ratio are typically used to determine the asthma severity. Accurate prediction of these spirometry readings from cough and wheeze could help patients to non-invasively monitor their asthma severity in the absence of spirometry. We use statistical spectrum description (SSD) as the cue from cough and wheeze signal to predict the spirometry readings using support vector regression (SVR). We perform experiments with cough and wheeze recordings from 16 healthy persons and 12 patients. We find that the coughs are better predictor of spirometry readings compared to the wheeze signal. FEV1%, FVC% and their ratio are predicted with root mean squared error of 11.06%, 10.3% and 0.08 respectively. We also perform a three class asthma severity level classification with predicted FEV1% and obtain an accuracy of 77.77%.},

  abstract = {Dose calculation from MRI is a topical issue. New treatment systems combining a linear accelerator with a MRI have been recently being developed. MRI has good soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation exposure. However, unlike CT, MRI does not provide electron density information necessary for dose calculation. We propose in this paper a machine learning method to simulate a CT from a target MRI and co-registered CT-MRI training set. Ten prostate MR and CT images have been considered. Firstly, a reference image was randomly selected in the training set. A common space has been built thanks to affine registrations between the training set and the reference image. Multiscale image descriptors such as spatial information, gradients and texture features were extracted from MRI patches at dilïerent levels of a Gaussian pyramid and used as voxel-wise characteristics in the learning scheme. A Conditional Inference Random Forest (CIRF) modelled the relation between MRI descriptors and CT patches. For validation, test images were spatially normalized and the same descriptors were computed to generate a new pCT. Leave-one out experiments were performed. We obtained a MAE = 45.79 (pCT vs CT). Dose volume histograms inside PTV and organs at risk are in close agreement. The D98% was 0.45 % (inside PTV) and the 3D gamma pass rate (1mm, 1%) was 99,2%. Our method has better results than direct bulk assignment. And the results suggest that the method may be used for dose calculations in an MR based planning system.},

  abstract = {Mammography is still the most effective procedure for early diagnosis of the breast cancer. Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can be very helpful in this direction for radiologists to recognize abnormal and normal regions of interest in digital mammograms faster than traditional screening program. In this work, we propose a new method for breast cancer identification of all types of lesions in digital mammograms using multimodal features in a quaternionic representation. The proposed method consists of two steps: First, a novel feature extraction module utilizes two dimensional discrete transforms based on ART, Shapelets, Zernike moments and Gabor filters to decompose Regions of Suspicion (ROS) into a set of localized basis functions with different shapes. The extracted features are then fused and presented in quaternionic representation to the classification module in the second step. For the classification task, we propose a new type of classifier (Q-classifier) that successfully, accurately, with low computational cost and higher speed of diagnosis, recognizes normal and abnormal ROS from mammograms. The proposed method is evaluated on the Mini-MIAS database. The methods' performance is evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. The achieved result AUC = 0.934 shows that the proposed method can be quite effective and can be used as a tool for efficiently diagnosing breast cancer compared to similar techniques presented in the literature that use SVM classifiers and unimodal features.},

  abstract = {Traditional image segmentation methods working with low level image features are usually difficult to adapt to higher level tasks, such as object recognition and scene understanding. Object segmentation emerges as a new challenge in this research field. It aims at obtaining more meaningful segments related to semantic objects in the scene by analyzing a combination of different information. 3D point cloud data obtained from consumer depth sensors has been exploited to tackle many computer vision problems due to its richer information about the geometry of 3D scenes compared to 2D images. Meanwhile, new challenges have also emerged as the depth information is usually noisy, sparse and unorganized. In this paper, we present a novel point cloud segmentation approach for segmenting interacting objects in a stream of point clouds by exploiting spatio-temporal coherence. We pose the problem as an energy minimization task in a fully connected conditional random field with the energy function defined based on both current and previous information. We compare different methods and prove the improved segmentation performance and robustness of the proposed approach in sequences with over 2k frames.},

The understanding and modeling of such behavior has implications for the design of embodied conversational agents, as well as computational approaches to conversational analysis. Recent approaches to extracting gaze directions from monocular camera footage have achieved accurate results. We investigate ways of processing the extracted gaze signals from videos to perform gaze aversion detection. We present novel approaches that are based on unsupervised classification using spectral clustering as well as optimization methods.

The TDOAs are modeled with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) trained in a robust manner with the expectation-conditional maximization algorithm and minorization-maximization approach. In situations of multiple microphone deployment, our method allows for the selection of the best microphone pair as part of the modeling and supports ad-hoc microphone placement. Such information can be useful for subsequent speech processing algorithms. We show that our method, which uses only spatial information, achieves up to 36.1% relative reduction in speaker error time compared to an open source toolkit using TDOA features and tested on the NIST RT05 multiparty meeting database.},

Typically, for speaker verification systems, varying vocal effort inputs during the testing stage significantly degrades system performance. Solutions such as feature mapping or addition of multi-style data during training and enrollment stages have been proposed but do not show similar advantages for the involved speaking styles. Herein, we focus attention on the extraction of invariant speaker-dependent information from normal and whispered speech, thus allowing for improved multi vocal effort speaker verification. We base our search on previously reported perceptual and acoustic insights and propose variants of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). We show the complementarity of the proposed features via three fusion schemes. Gains as high as 39% and 43% can be achieved for normal and whispered speech, respectively, relative to the existing systems based on conventional MFCC features.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {101-105},
  abstract = {Speaker recognition researchers acknowledge that systems which aim to verify speakers automatically based on their pronunciation of an utterance are vulnerable to spoofing attacks using voice conversion and speech synthesis technologies. The first automatic speaker verification spoofing and countermeasures challenge (ASVspoof2015) was designed to stimulate interest in this problem among the speaker recognition communities. In the course of the challenge and subsequently, it became clear that the most effective countermeasures against spoofing attacks are low-level acoustic features (typically extracted at 10 ms intervals) designed to detect artifacts in synthetic or voice converted speech. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the infinite impulse response - constant Q transform (IIR-CQT) spectrum-based cepstral coefficients (ICQC) as anti-spoofing front-end. The IIR-CQT spectrum is estimated by filtering the multi-resolution fast Fourier transform with an infinite impulse response filter. These features can be used on their own with a standard Gaussian mixture model backend to detect spoofing attacks or they can be used in tandem with bottleneck features which are extracted from a bottleneck layer in a deep neural network designed to discriminate between synthetic and natural speech. We show that the ICQC features are capable of producing very low equal error rates on the individual spoofing attacks in the ASVspoof2015 data set (0.02% on the known attacks, 0.23% on the unknown attacks, and 0.13% on average). Moreover, with a single decision threshold (common to all of the attacks), the ICQC front end yielded an equal error rate of 0.20%.},

  abstract = {We define a multiaccess communication scheme that effectively eliminates interference and resolves collisions in many-to-one and many-to-many communication scenarios. Each transmitter is uniquely identified by a coding vector. Using these vectors, all signals issued from a specific transmitter will be aligned along a unique dimension at all receivers hearing this transmission. This dimension is characteristic of the transmitter. It also lies within a signal-and-noise subspace that is orthogonal to the noise-only subspace at the receiver. Signals along each dimension of the signal-and-noise subspace can be extracted separately using the properties of the Vandermonde matrix. The decoding algorithm is thus able to asymptotically achieve full network capacity at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to 50% and 36.79% asymptotic throughputs for interference alignment and Ethernet respectively. Synchronization is assumed between the transmitters and the receiver(s). The number of transmitters is not necessarily known to each receiver.},

The TWRN consists of two end nodes and a relay, where each node has a single antenna and operates in a half-duplex mode. Using an analytical approach, we derive the end-to-end symbol error rate (SER) performance expression of the 4/16-QAM HM for the high priority (HP) and the low priority (LP) streams, respectively, as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It has been found the analytical and simulation results are in close agreement. The utilization of the proposed HM-PLNC system minimizes the computational complexity of the denoise and forward (DNF) operations at the relay by reducing the number of Euclidean distance computations required to 18 compared to the 49 required in an equivalent 16-QAM based PLNC system.},

However, STNC schemes require all the relays to overhear the signal transmitted from all the sources in the network and also a large number of time-slots to achieve full diversity in a multipoint-to-multipoint transmission, which is particularly challenging for large cellular networks. In this paper, we exploit a basic knowledge of the network topology, i.e. the knowledge of the base stations overheard by other base stations and users, to reduce drastically the number of time-slots.

  abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, anchor positions play an important role for accurate localization. For mobile anchor (MA) based scenarios, both the efficiency of the path planning algorithm and the accuracy of the localization mechanism are critical for the best performance. In this work, an adaptive path planning algorithm is proposed based on Gauss-Markov mobility model, while the sensors are localized using alternating minimization approach. Path planning, which combines the velocity adjustment, the perpendicular bisector and the virtual repulsive strategies, is improved by developing virtual attractive force strategy. The surveillance area is divided into grids and a virtual attractive force is applied to the MA in sparsely and densely populated areas. For localization, the non-convex optimization problem is converted into a bi-convex form and solved by alternating minimization algorithm leading to a shorter MA path. The simulation results show that introducing the virtual attractive strategy increases the path planning accuracy and cover more surveillance region using less energy. Furthermore, compared to the linear localization method, the localization accuracy increases when the alternating minimization is used.},

Performance of an online algorithm in this setting is assessed by: i) the difference of its losses relative to the best dynamic solution with one-slot-ahead information of the loss function and the constraint (that is here termed dynamic regret); and, ii) the accumulated amount of constraint violations (that is here termed dynamic fit). In this context, a modified online saddle-point (MOSP) scheme is developed, and proved to simultaneously yield sub-linear dynamic regret and fit, provided that the accumulated variations of per-slot minimizers and constraints are sub-linearly growing with time. MOSP is applied to the dynamic network resource allocation task, and shown to outperform the well-known stochastic dual gradient method.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {151-155},
  abstract = {Graphs are naturally sparse objects that are used to study many problems involving networks, for example, distributed learning and graph signal processing. In some cases, the graph is not given, but must be learned from the problem and available data. Often it is desirable to learn sparse graphs. However, making a graph highly sparse can split the graph into several disconnected components, leading to several separate networks. The main difficulty is that connectedness is often treated as a combinatorial property, making it hard to enforce in e.g. convex optimization problems. In this article, we show how connectedness of undirected graphs can be formulated as an analytical property and can be enforced as a convex constraint. We especially show how the constraint relates to the distributed consensus problem and graph Laplacian learning. Using simulated and real data, we perform experiments to learn sparse and connected graphs from data.},

  pages = {156-160},
  abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering an unknown signal observed through a nonlinear model and corrupted with additive noise. More precisely, the nonlinear degradation consists of a convolution followed by a nonlinear rational transform. As a prior information, the original signal is assumed to be sparse. We tackle the problem by minimizing a least-squares fit criterion penalized by a Geman-McClure like potential. In order to find a globally optimal solution to this rational minimization problem, we transform it in a generalized moment problem, for which a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations can be used. To overcome computational limitations on the number of involved variables, the structure of the problem is carefully addressed, yielding a sparse relaxation able to deal with up to several hundreds of optimized variables. Our experiments show the good performance of the proposed approach.},

In this work, we show that these auxiliary samples can be recycled within the Gibbs estimators, improving their efficiency with no extra cost. Theoretical and exhaustive numerical comparisons show the validity of the approach.},

  abstract = {It is well known that a faulty gearbox vibration signal exhibits an amplitude modulation (AM) as well as a phase modulation (PM). These modulation carry out a lot of useful information about health condition. This paper presents two approaches for modeling amplitude and phase modulation in gearbox vibration signal. These last are used to describe the vibration signal by a state space model. Then, the H∞ estimator is designed to estimate the modulation appearing in the vibration signal. This estimator is obtained by minimizing the worst possible amplification effects of disturbances (measurement and modeling noises) on the estimation error. Such an estimator does not require any assumption on the statistic properties of the noises. Since additive noises in gearbox vibration signal are non Gaussian and non white, this estimator is more suitable in practical gearbox diagnosis. To evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we use a synthetic and an experimental gearbox vibration signal.},

To this end, we apply the well-known matching pursuit algorithm (MPA). Even if there are theoretical results on the performance of MPA, there is no widely accepted rule for stopping the algorithm. In this work, we focus on stopping rules based on information theoretic criteria (ITC). The key point is to evaluate the degrees of freedom (df) for the model produced at each iteration. This is traditionally done by computing the trace of the hat matrix which maps the data vector to its estimate. We prove some theoretical results concerning the hat matrix. One of them provides an upper bound on the increase of df from the m-th to the (m + 1)-th iteration. Based on the properties of the hat matrix, we propose novel ITC for selecting the number of iterations. All of them are obtained by modifying criteria designed for variable selection in the classical linear model. For assessing the performance of the novel criteria, we conduct a simulation study.},

The method relies on a hierarchical model and a Bayesian strategy to jointly estimate the labels, the textured images as well as the hyperparameters. An important point is that the parameter of the Potts field is also estimated. The estimators are designed in an optimal manner (marginal posterior maximizer for the labels and posterior mean for the other unknowns). They are computed based on a convergent procedure, from samples of the posterior obtained through an MCMC algorithm (Gibbs sampler including Perturbation-Optimization). A first numerical evaluation provides encouraging results despite the strong difficulty of the problem.},

Using a camera, a picture of every wheel is captured for traceability. This image is used, in our problem, to measure the coating intensity via pixels mean value. In our operational context, it is wished to control the false alarm probability over a long period (typically a day) as well as to keep the detection delay under a given number of observations, which corresponds to a small number of wheels with defective coating. The problem of abrupt coating problem detection is addressed using a sequential method that takes into account those two requirements while it is also able to adapt to the non-stationnarity of the process.

In this context, a distributed state estimation architecture is considered where a remote sensor communicates its measurements to the fusion centre (FC) in an event-based fashion. We propose a systematic and intuitively pleasing distributed state estimation algorithm which jointly incorporates point and set-valued measurements within the particle filtering framework. Referred to as the event-based particle filter (EBPF), point-valued measurements are incorporated in the estimation recursion via a conventional particle filter formulation, while set-valued measurements are incorporated by developing an observation update step similar in nature to quantized particle filtering approach. More specifically, in the absence of an observation (i.e., having a set-valued measurement), the proposed EBPF evaluates the probability that the unknown observation belongs to the event-triggering set based on its particles which is then used to update the corresponding particle weights. The simulation results show that the proposed EBPF outperforms its counterparts specifically in low communication rates, and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid estimation algorithm.},

Most speech intelligibility metrics are intrusive, i.e., they require a clean reference signal, which is rarely available in real-life applications. This paper proposes a method, which allows using an intrusive short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric without requiring access to a clean signal. The clean speech reference signal is replaced by the clean speech envelope spectrum estimated from the noisy signal. The spectral envelope has been shown to be an important cue for speech intelligibility and is used as the reference signal inside STOI. The spectral envelopes are estimated as a combination of predefined dictionaries, i.e., code-books, that best fits the noisy speech signal. The simulations show a high correlation between the proposed non-intrusive codebook-based STOI (NIC-STOI) and the intrusive STOI indicating that NIC-STOI is a suitable metric for automatic classification of speech signals.},

We propose to optimize jointly for both the source location and the head radius. In contrast to the free-field configuration where it is difficult to estimate the source location and microphone distance simultaneously, the binaural algorithm yields a unique solution to the head radius. Moreover, for real recordings we show that the commonly-assumed size of the head achieves a fairly reliable performance.

  pages = {226-230},
  abstract = {In hearing aids (HAs), the acoustic coupling between the microphone and the receiver results in the system becoming unstable under certain conditions and causes artifacts commonly referred to as whistling or howling. The least mean square (LMS) class of algorithms is commonly used to mitigate this by providing adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC). The speech quality after AFC and the amount of added stable gain (ASG) with AFC are used to assess these algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the LMS that promotes sparsity in estimating the acoustic feedback path. By using the lp norm as a diversity measure, the approach does not enforce, but takes advantage of sparsity when it exists. The performance in terms of speech quality, misalignment, and ASG of the proposed algorithm is compared with other proportionate-type LMS algorithms which also leverage sparsity in the feedback path. We demonstrate faster convergence compared with those algorithms, quality improvement of about 0.25 (on a 0-1 objective scale of the hearing-aid speech quality index (HASQI)), and about 5 dB ASG improvement compared with the normalized LMS (NLMS).},

For such an earpiece it has previously been proposed to use a fixed null-steering beamformer to reduce the acoustic feedback in the microphones. In this paper we propose to combine the fixed null-steering beamformer with an additional adaptive filter to cancel the residual feedback component in the beamformer output. We compare the combination of the fixed null-steering beamformer and different adaptive filtering algorithms including subband adaptive filtering and the prediction-error-method based fullband adaptive filtering with using either of the two approaches alone. Experimental results using measured acoustic feedback show the benefit of using the combined approach compared to using either of the two approaches to cancel the acoustic feedback.},

The LP-PNMCC algorithm is realized by integrating a lp-norm into the PNMCC's cost function to create an expected zero attraction term in the iterations of the presented LP-PNMCC algorithm, which aims to further exploit the sparsity property of the sparse channels. The presented LP-PNMCC algorithm has been derived and analyzed in detail.

The proposed Bayesian approach takes advantage of the distribution of the multiplicative speckle noise affecting the true reflectivity of these images and of appropriate priors for the unknown model rameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the model parameters and the image of true reflectivity while classifying images according to the distribution of their reflectivity. Precisely, a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler is investigated to sample the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model associated with RCM images and to build estimators of its parameters, including labels indicating the class of each RCM image. The resulting algorithm is applied to synthetic data and to real images from a clinical study containing healthy and lentigo patients.},

  abstract = {Hyperparameter estimation is a recurrent problem in the signal and statistics literature. Popular strategies are cross-validation or Bayesian inference, yet it remains an active topic of research in order to offer better or faster algorithms. The models considered here are sparse regression models with convex or non-convex group-Lasso-like penalties. Following the recent work of Pereyra et al. [1] we study the fixed point iteration algorithm they propose and show that, while it may be suitable for an analysis prior, it suffers from limitations when using high-dimensional sparse synthesis models. The first contribution of this paper is to show how to overcome this issue. Secondly, we demonstrate how one can extend the model to estimate a vector of regularization parameters. We illustrate this on models with group sparsity reporting improved support recovery and reduced amplitude bias on the estimated coefficients. This approach is compared with an alternative method that uses a single parameter but a non-convex penalty. Results are presented on simulations and an inverse problem relevant for neuroscience which is the localization of brain activations using magneto/electroencephalography.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {251-255},
  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of distinct muscles is a crucial step for quantitative analysis of muscle's tissue properties. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a superior soft tissue contrast and noninvasive means for assessing muscular characteristics. However, automatic segmentation of muscles using common morphological MR imaging is very challenging as the intensities and textures of adjacent muscles are similar and the boundaries between them are mostly invisible or discontinuous. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic framework for 3D segmentation of muscles on water MR images. This framework generates the 3D average and probabilistic atlases of the targeted muscle to automatically define the labeled seeds, the edges weights, and the constraints of a constrained Random Walker algorithm. Also, the low-pass filtered atlas-derived muscle probability map is used to augment the intensities prior to the graph-based segmentation. This enables automatic localization of the targeted muscle and enforces dissimilarities between its intensities and the intensities of adjacent lean tissues. The proposed algorithm outperforms the original random Walker algorithm and the conventional multi-atlas registration for muscle segmentation and is less sensitive to errors in the manually segmented muscle masks used for training (atlas computation).},

They introduce distortions and cause difficulties in their analysis. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process-based method that can utilize other intrapartum signals (e.g., uterine activity and maternal heart rate) to recover the missing samples in FHR recordings. The proposed approach was tested on a short real FHR recording segment and its performance was compared with that of cubic spline interpolation which is widely used in pre-processing of FHR recordings. Our results show that the proposed approach, with utilization of UA signals, achieves 2.35 dB to 14.85 dB better recovery performance. Furthermore, even when the percentage of missing samples is more than 50%, the mean square error of this approach is still below one beat per minute.},

  abstract = {Communication networks can be the targets of organized and distributed attacks such as flooding-type DDOS attack in which malicious users aim to cripple a network server or a network domain. For the attack to have a major effect on the network, malicious users must act in a coordinated and time correlated manner. For instance, the members of the flooding attack increase their message transmission rates rapidly but also synchronously. Even though detection and prevention of the flooding attacks are well studied at network and transport layers, the emergence and wide deployment of new systems such as VoIP (Voice over IP) have turned flooding attacks at the session layer into a new defense challenge. In this study a structured sparsity based group anomaly detection system is proposed that not only can detect synchronized attacks, but also identify the malicious groups from normal users by jointly estimating their members, structure, starting and end points. Although we mainly focus on security on SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) servers/proxies which are widely used for signaling in VoIP systems, the proposed scheme can be easily adapted for any type of communication network system at any layer.},

However, many applications require to deal with data from different sources regularly, thus needing to overcome these interoperability problems. Here, we employ fusion of several comparators to improve periocular performance when images from different smartphones are compared. We use a probabilistic fusion framework based on linear logistic regression, in which fused scores tend to be log-likelihood ratios, obtaining a reduction in cross-sensor EER of up to 40% due to the fusion. Our framework also provides an elegant and simple solution to handle signals from different devices, since same-sensor and cross-sensor score distributions are aligned and mapped to a common probabilistic domain. This allows the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision making, eliminating the need of sensor-specific thresholds, which is essential in operational conditions because the threshold setting critically determines the accuracy of the authentication process in many applications.},

To minimize the cost of labeling a sufficient amount of events, active learning can be employed. By using only a small set of labeled samples for initial training followed by selecting only the most informative samples to be labeled, the total number of labeled training samples can be reduced significantly. The performance of an active learning system strongly depends on the choice of the initial training set and the used query strategy. We thus investigated the impact of different methods to select the dataset for initial training as well as various query strategies on the resulting classification accuracy in an event-based NILM framework.

The well known Bag-of-Features (BoF) model was recently adapted towards time-series representation. In this work, a neural generalization of the BoF model, composed of an RBF layer and an accumulation layer, is proposed as a neural layer that receives the features extracted from a time-series and gradually builds its representation. The proposed method can be combined with any other layer or classifier, such as fully connected layers or feature transformation layers, to form deep neural networks for time-series classification. The resulting networks are end-to-end differentiable and they can be trained using regular back-propagation. It is demonstrated, using two time-series datasets, including a large-scale financial dataset, that the proposed approach can significantly increase the classification metrics over other baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.},

Commonly, they provide quantitative services, such as personalized training instructions or the counting of distances. But qualitative monitoring and assessment is still missing, e.g., to detect malpositions, to prevent injuries, or to optimize training success. We address this issue by presenting a concept for qualitative as well as generic assessment of recurrent human motion by processing multi-dimensional, continuous time series tracked with motion sensors. Therefore, our segmentation procedure extracts individual events of specific length and we propose expressive features to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment by supervised classification. We verified our approach within a comprehensive study encompassing 27 athletes undertaking different body weight exercises. We are able to recognize six different exercise types with a success rate of 100% and to assess them qualitatively with an average success rate of 99.3%.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a staple in the fields of computer vision and image processing. These networks perform visual tasks with state-of-the-art accuracy; yet, the understanding behind the success of these algorithms is still lacking. In particular, the process by which CNNs learn effective task-specific features is still unclear. This work elucidates such phenomena by applying recent deep visualization techniques during different stages of the training process. Additionally, this investigation provides visual justification to the benefits of transfer learning. The results are in line with previously discussed notions of feature specificity, and show a new facet of a particularly vexing machine learning pitfall: overfitting.},

When the cost function is the squared error, the fitting can be accomplished based on efficient recursions. In this paper, the squared error cost is generalized to more advanced cost functions while preserving recursive computations: first, the standard sample-wise squared error is augmented with a sample-dependent polynomial error; second, the sample-wise errors are localized by a window function that is itself described by an autonomous LSSM. It is further demonstrated how such a signal estimation can be extended to handle unknown additive and/or multiplicative interference. All these results rely on two facts: first, the correlation function between a given discrete-time signal and a LSSM signal can be computed by efficient recursions; second, the set of LSSM signals is a ring.},

  abstract = {Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are of fundamental importance in classical digital signal processing. LTI systems are linear operators commuting with the time-shift operator. For N-periodic discrete time series the time-shift operator is a circulant N × N permutation matrix. Sandryhaila and Moura developed a linear discrete signal processing framework and corresponding tools for datasets arising from social, biological, and physical networks. In their framework, the circulant permutation matrix is replaced by a network-specific N × N matrix A, called a shift matrix, and the linear shift-invariant (LSI) systems are all N × N matrices H over C commuting with the shift matrix: HA = AH. Sandryhaila and Moura described all those H for the non-degenerate case, in which all eigenspaces of A are one-dimensional. Then the authors reduced the degenerate case to the non-degenerate one. As we show in this paper this reduction does, however, not generally hold, leaving open one gap in the proposed argument. In this paper we are able to close this gap and propose a complete characterization of all (i.e., degenerate and non-degenerate) LSI systems. Finally, we describe the corresponding spectral decompositions.},

In particular, these processes embed long range transitions, the Levy flights, that are capable of one-step jumps between far-distant states (nodes) of the graph. The present contribution envisions to build upon these volatile random walks to propose a new version of graph based semi-supervised learning algorithms whose classification outcome could benefit from the dynamics induced by the fractional transition matrix.},

This paper proposes a procedure for learning the adjacency matrix of a graph providing support to a set of irregularly sampled image values. Our approach to the graph adjacency matrix learning takes into account both the image luminance and the spatial samples' distances, and leads to a flexible and computationally light parametric procedure. We show that, under mild conditions, the proposed procedure identifies a near optimal graph for Markovian fields; specifically, the links identified by the learning procedure minimize the potential energy of the Markov random field for the signal samples under concern. We also show, by numerical simulations, that the learned adjacency matrix leads to a higly compact spectral wavelet graph transform of the so obtained signal on graph and favourably compares to state-of-the-art graph learning procedures, definetly matching the intrinsic signal structure.},

  abstract = {Vector sensors are directional receivers that measure the vectorial particle velocity associated with an acoustic wave rather than the scalar pressure. Therefore, arrays of vector sensors possess some desirable directional properties compared to conventional arrays of pressure sensors. In this paper, a modal beamformer for circular arrays of 1-D acoustic vectors sensors are presented. Arrays of both radially and circumferentially oriented vector sensors are considered. It is shown that the highly directional modes of the acoustic velocity field can be extracted from the sensor measurements using the spatial Fourier transform. These modes are weighted and combined to form narrow steerable beams. The highest order of mode that can be extracted is limited by the number of vector sensors utilized in the array. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations indicate that the proposed modal beamformer attains the same directivity performance as that of circular pressure sensor array beamformers but outperforms them in terms of white noise gain. In addition, it uses half the number of sensors to achieve the same directivity performance of a circular vector sensor array modal beamformer reported previously in the literature. The proposed method is suitable for in-air and underwater low frequencies array processing applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, joint frequency and 2-D direction of arrival (DOA) estimation at sub-Nyquist sampling rates of a multi-band signal (MBS) comprising of P disjoint narrowband signals is considered. Beginning with a standard uniform rectangular array (URA) consisting of M = Mx × My sensors, this paper proposes a simpler modification by adding a N - 1 delay channel network to only one of the sensor. A larger array is then formed by combining the sub-Nyquist sampled outputs of URA and the delay channel network, referred to as the difference space-time (DST) array. Towards estimating the joint frequency and 2-D DOA on this DST array, a new method utilizing the 3-D spatial smoothing for rank enhancement and a subspace algorithm based on ESPRIT is presented. Furthermore, it is shown that an ADC sampling frequency of fs ≥ B suffices, where B is the bandwidth of the narrow-band signal. With the proposed approach, it is shown that O(MN/4) frequencies and their 2-D DOAs can be estimated even when all frequencies alias to the same frequency due to sub-Nyquist sampling. Appropriate simulation results are also presented to corroborate these findings.},

  abstract = {Future wireless networks demand multicarrier modulation schemes with improved spectrum efficiency and superior spectrum containment. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been the favorite technique in recent developments, but due to its limited spectrum containment, various alternative schemes are under consideration for future systems. Theoretically, it is not possible to reach maximum spectrum efficiency, high spectral containment, and orthogonality of subcarriers simultaneously, when using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for subcarriers. This has motivated the study of non-orthogonal multicarrier modulation schemes. This paper focuses on the filtered multitone (FMT) scheme, one of the classical configurations of filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) modulation utilizing QAM subcarrier symbols. Our main aim is to improve the spectral efficiency of FMT by introducing controlled overlap of adjacent subchannels. An analytical model is developed for evaluating the tradeoffs between spectrum efficiency and intercarrier interference (ICI) introduced by the overlap. An efficient fast convolution waveform processing scheme is adopted for the generation of the proposed waveform. It allows effective adjustment of the roll-off and subcarrier spacing to facilitate waveform adaptation in real time. Analytical studies, confirmed by simulation results, indicate that the proposed FMT system can obtain significant spectral density improvement without requiring additional ICI cancellation techniques.},

  abstract = {In discrete multitone (DMT) modulation systems, the channel duration can be longer than the cyclic prefix, yielding both inter-block and inter-carrier interference. In order to avoid these effects, time-domain equalization (TEQ) techniques are usually employed before DMT demodulation. This letter introduces a modification of the iterative minimum delay spread (MDS) method proposed by Lopez-Valcarce in [1] to adapt the TEQ coefficients to the channel. The proposed solution is based on a) the approximation to the solution of a set of equation, and b) a new reference time selection. The resulting scheme requires only a single matrix inversion at the last iteration rather than one per iteration, achieving a significantly lower implementation complexity than iterative MDS, while performing similarly in terms of spectral efficiency.},

  pages = {415-419},
  abstract = {In modern wireless networks, optimizing the association between base stations (BSs) and users effectively improves network performance. On the other hand, a frequently changing BS-user association renders considerable operational burden for network management, e.g., it consumes extra power to awaken the deactivated BSs and to support users' switching among BSs. This motivates us to balance the flexibility and stability of BS-user association, leading to a long-term BS association problem. In this paper, we address this by considering the green communication problem in a MISO network where multiple BSs cooperatively forward information to multiple users. We minimize total power consumption (including not only the transmit power and device maintenance power, but also the switching power consumed as the BS-user association changes) by joint long-term BS activation and beamforming, i.e., we jointly optimize the active BSs, the transmit beamformer and the user switching frequency among BSs. Due to the inherent causality constraints on channel state information (CSI), we develop an online algorithm for the optimization problem, utilizing the sample average approximation (SAA) method. To improve the algorithm's efficiency, we further fit the problem into the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and finally design a low-complexity distributed online algorithm for the green communication problem.},

  abstract = {Filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) systems have been considered as a prevalent candidate for replacing the long established cyclic prefix (CP)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) in the physical layer of next generation communications systems. In particular, offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM)-based FBMC has received increasing attention due to, among other features, its potential for maximum spectral efficiency. It suffers, however, from an intrinsic self-interference effect, which complicates signal processing tasks at the receiver, including synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, the multi-antenna interference has also to be taken into account. (Semi-)blind FBMC/OQAM receivers have been little studied so far and mainly for single-antenna systems. The problem of joint channel estimation and data detection in a MIMO-FBMC/OQAM system, given limited or no training information, is studied in this paper through a tensor-based viewpoint in the light of the success of such techniques in OFDM applications. Simulation-based comparisons with CP-OFDM are included, for realistic transmission models.},

  pages = {425-429},
  abstract = {Unmixing is a ubiquitous task in hyperspectral image analysis which consists in jointly extracting typical spectral signatures and estimating their respective proportions in the voxels, providing an explicit spatial mapping of these elementary signatures over the observed scene. Inspired by this approach, this paper aims at proposing a new framework for analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images. More precisely, a PET-dedicated mixing model and an associated unmixing algorithm are derived to jointly estimate time-activity curves (TAC) characterizing each type of tissues, and the proportions of those tissues in the voxels of the imaged brain. In particular, the TAC corresponding to the specific binding class is expected to be voxel-wise dependent. The proposed approach allows this intrinsic spatial variability to be properly modeled, mitigated and quantified. Finally, the main contributions of the paper are twofold: first, we demonstrate that the unmixing concept is an appropriate analysis tool for dynamic PET images; and second, we propose a novel unmixing algorithm allowing for variability, which significantly improves the analysis and interpretation of dynamic PET images when compared with state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms.},

The use of Matching Pursuit algorithm in biological signals has concentrated on brain signals and much less on human motion. Thus we contribute to efficacy of the algorithm by employing it on rehabilitative data collected from widely available sensors.

In this contribution, a new strategy is proposed to select a suitable model order for potentially nonlinear systems. A nonlinear vectorial autoregressive model based on a wavelet network is considered for the identification and an optimal nonlinear model order is selected using the Bayesian information criterion and imported in nonlinear kernel predictors to derive Granger causality. Simulations are firstly conducted on a linear autoregressive model, then on toy nonlinear models and, finally, on simulated intracranial electroencephalographic signals obtained from an electrophysiology based model to reveal the directional relationships between time series data.

Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) is a sensing and reconstruction framework, based on the fundamentals of the compressive sensing theory, which focuses on capturing spectral images efficiently, exploiting their highly correlated information by coding its spectral characteristics commonly using a black-and-white, grayscale or recently a color coded aperture. The distribution of the entries of the coded apertures determines the quality of the estimated spectral images. State of the art methods have used random coded apertures, and some optimization procedures have focused on the optimal design of horizontal sections of the coded apertures; however, they do not fully exploit the spatio-spectral correlations within the spectral images. To that end, in this paper, it is proposed a high-dimensional optimization procedure to design color coded apertures for CSI systems, which exploits not only the spectral correlations but also the spatial correlations within an spectral image. Simulations analyzing the conditioning of the sensing matrices, as well as the reconstruction quality of the attained spectral images show the improvement entailed by the proposed method.},

Furthermore, the single-pixel camera (SPC) has been also employed for spectral imaging. Specifically, the SPC captures the spatial and spectral information in a single measurement. CSI reconstructions are traditionally obtained by solving a minimization problem using iterative algorithms. However, the computational load of these algorithms is high due to the dimensionality of the involved sensing matrices. In this paper, a multi-resolution (MR) reconstruction model is proposed such that the complexity of the inverse problem is reduced. In particular, this model uses the spectral correlation to group pixels with similar spectral characteristics. Simulation results show that the MR model improves the reconstruction PSNR in up to 9dB with respect to the traditional methods. In addition, the proposed approach is 79% faster, using only 25% of the measurements.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging has been rarely investigated for honey analyses, on the contrary to the optical spectroscopy which is widely investigated. The essential missing component to kick start this research is a standard honey hyperspectral images, called hypercubes, dataset. This paper proposes a systematic procedure for the preparation of the first honey hypercube dataset using hyperspectral imaging. Moreover, a scalable and flexible dataset module is introduced to ease the interaction between raw hypercube data and machine learning software.

  pages = {498-502},
  abstract = {The Euclid satellite aims to measure accurately the global properties of the Universe, with particular emphasis on the properties of the mysterious Dark Energy that is driving the acceleration of its expansion. One of its two main observational probes relies on accurate measurements of the radial distances of galaxies through the identification of important features in their individual light spectra that are redshifted due to their receding velocity. However, several challenges for robust automated spectroscopic redshift estimation remain unsolved, one of which is the characterization of the types of spectra present in the observed galaxy population. This paper proposes a denoising technique that exploits the mathematical frameworks of Sparse Representations and Coupled Dictionary Learning, and tests it on simulated Euclid-like noisy spectroscopic templates. The reconstructed spectral profiles are able to improve the accuracy, reliability and robustness of automated redshift estimation methods. The key contribution of this work is the design of a novel model which considers coupled feature spaces, composed of high- and low-quality spectral profiles, when applied to the spectroscopic data denoising problem. The coupled dictionary learning technique is formulated within the context of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, optimizing each variable via closed-form expressions. Experimental results suggest that the proposed powerful coupled dictionary learning scheme reconstructs successfully spectral profiles from their corresponding noisy versions, even with extreme noise scenarios.},

Despite various techniques have been proposed in the literature to detect and recognize buried objects, automatic and easy to use systems providing accurate performance are still under research. Given the incredible results achieved by deep learning in many detection tasks, in this paper we propose a pipeline for buried landmine detection based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images. The proposed algorithm is capable of recognizing whether a B-scan profile obtained from GPR acquisitions contains traces of buried mines. Validation of the presented system is carried out on real GPR acquisitions, albeit system training can be performed simply relying on synthetically generated data. Results show that it is possible to reach 95% of detection accuracy without training in real acquisition of landmine profiles.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how well an automatic crater detection algorithm is suitable to determine the surface age of different lunar regions. A template-based crater detection algorithm is used to analyze image data under known illumination conditions. For this purpose, artificially illuminated crater templates are used to detect and count craters and their diameters in the areas under investigation. The automatic detection results are used to obtain the crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) for the examined areas, which is then used for estimating the absolute model age (AMA) of the surface. The main focus of this work is to find out whether there exists an ideal sensitivity value for automatic crater detection to obtain smallest possible errors between the automatically derived AMA and a reference AMA derived from manually detected craters. The detection sensitivity threshold of our crater detection algorithm (CDA) is calibrated based on five different regions in Mare Cognitum on the Moon such that the age inferred from the manual crater counts corresponds to the age inferred from the CDA results. The obtained best detection threshold value is used to apply the CDA algorithm to another five regions in the lunar Oceanus Procellarum region. The accuracy of the method is examined by comparing the calculated AMAs with the manually determined ones from the literature. It is shown that the automatic age estimation yields AMA values that are generally consistent with the reference values with respect to the one standard deviation errors.},

Multiple dictionaries corresponding to different mixture are learned using the respective speech frames. Given a train/test speech frame, minimum spectral distance measure from the GMM means is employed to select an appropriate dictionary. The selected dictionary is used to obtain the sparse feature representation, which is used for the classification of speech units.

  abstract = {Point Process Models (PPM) have been widely used for keyword spotting applications. Training these models typically requires a considerable number of keyword examples. In this work, we consider a scenario where very few keyword examples are available for training. The availability of a limited number of training examples results in a PPM with poorly learnt parameters. We propose an unsupervised online learning algorithm that starts from a poor PPM model and updates the PPM parameters using newly detected samples of the keyword in a corpus under consideration and uses the updated model for further keyword detection. We test our algorithm on eight keywords taken from the TIMIT database, the training set of which, on average, has 469 samples of each keyword. With an initial set of only five samples of a keyword (corresponds to ~ 1% of the total number of samples) followed by the proposed online parameter updating throughout the entire TIMIT train set, the performance on the TIMIT test set using the final model is found to be comparable to that of a PPM trained with all the samples of the respective keyword available from the entire TIMIT train set.},

In a Hidden Markov model-Deep neural network (HMM-DNN) based speech recognition system, DNNs have been employed to model senones (context dependent states of HMM), where HMMs capture the temporal relations among senones. Due to the use of more deeper networks significant improvement in the performances has been observed and developing deep learning methods to train more deeper architectures has gained a lot of scientific interest. Optimizing a deeper network is more complex task than to optimize a less deeper network, but recently residual network have exhibited a capability to train a very deep neural network architectures and are not prone to vanishing/exploding gradient problems. In this work, the effectiveness of residual networks have been explored for of speech recognition. Along with the depth of the residual network, the criticality of width of the residual network has also been studied. It has been observed that at higher depth, width of the networks is also a crucial parameter for attaining significant improvements. A 14-hour subset of WSJ corpus is used for training the speech recognition systems, it has been observed that the residual networks have shown much ease in convergence even with a depth much higher than the deep neural network. In this work, using residual networks an absolute reduction of 0.4 in WER error rates (8% reduction in the relative error) is attained compared to the best performing deep neural network.},

  abstract = {The performance of automatic speech recognition systems under noisy environments still leaves room for improvement. Speech enhancement or feature enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple curriculum training strategy called accordion annealing (ACCAN). It uses a multi-stage training schedule where samples at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values as low as 0dB are first added and samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up to an SNR value of 50dB. We also use a method called per-epoch noise mixing (PEM) that generates noisy training samples online during training and thus enables dynamically changing the SNR of our training data. Both the ACCAN and the PEM methods are evaluated on a end-to-end speech recognition pipeline on the Wall Street Journal corpus. ACCAN decreases the average word error rate (WER) on the 20dB to -10dB SNR range by up to 31.4% when compared to a conventional multi-condition training method.},

Compared to the power spectrogram, the time-frequency reassigned version is particularly helpful in describing simultaneously the temporal and spectral features of speech signals, as it offers an improved visualization of the various components. This powerful attribute is exploited from the cepstral reassigned features, which are incorporated in a state-of-the-art speech recognizer. Experimental activities investigate the proposed features in various scenarios, starting from recognition of close-talk signals and gradually increasing the complexity of the task.

In this paper, we propose the use of Gaussian posteriorgram of VTLN-warped spectral features for a Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection (QbE-STD). This paper presents the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework for estimation of VTLN warping factor. This GMM framework does not require phoneme-level transcription and hence, it can be useful for unsupervised tasks. We propose the iterative approach for VTLN warping factor estimation with two GMM training approaches, namely, Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Deterministic Annealing-Expectation Maximization (DAEM). The VTLN-warped Gaussian posteriorgram gave the better QbE-STD performance. The performance of TIMIT QbE-STD was investigated with different evaluation factors, such as a number of Gaussian components in GMM, various local constraints, and a number of iterations in VTLN warping factor estimation. VTLN-warped Gaussian posteriorgram reduces the speaker-specific variation in Gaussian posteriorgram and hence, it is expected to give better performance than Gaussian posteriorgram.},

The IRM provides information regarding the amount of signal power at each Time-Frequency (T-F) unit in a given signal-plus-noise mixture. In this paper, we propose to use the IRM for non-intrusive quality assessment of noise suppressed speech. Since the quality of noise suppressed speech is dependent on the residual noise present in speech, IRM can be extremely useful for its quality assessment. The quality assessment problem is posed as a regression problem and the mapping between statistics of acoustic features, namely, Mel Filterbank Energies (FBEs) plus IRM features and the subjective score of the corresponding utterances was found using single-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results of our experiments suggest that by using the mean of FBEs and IRM features as the input, the quality prediction accuracy was significantly increased.},

  abstract = {Noise pollution has a large negative influence on the health of humans, especially in case of long-term exposure. Various passive hearing protection approaches are available. However, they often lack good protection against low frequency noise. For these applications, the principle of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) offers a promising supplement. It relies on anti-phase compensation of the noise signal. Within the area of ANC, only few publications deal with the Kalman filter approach. The state-of-the-art in literature is briefly reviewed. The algorithm presented in this contribution is inspired by the time-domain Kalman filter. The Kalman filter has the favorable property of fast convergence as well as good tracking properties. Especially the tracking of time-varying noise conditions is often a drawback of least-mean-square (LMS) and recursive-least-square (RLS) approaches. The proposed algorithm uses the Kalman equations which are extended by online model parameter estimation based on observable signals. This results in faster convergence and higher robustness against dynamically changing noise conditions. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by means of convergence, tracking and stability with measured acoustic paths from a real-time system.},

The proposed modification of deciding which TF tile is target-or noise-dominated leads to choices, which are better aligned with simultaneous masking properties of the auditory system, and, hence, improves the performance over the initial version of the algorithm.},

The magnitude response of the headphones is estimated using arbitrary reproduced sounds. Then, the headphone response is equalized to a user-selected target response with a graphical equalizer. Measurements show that the proposed algorithm produces accurate estimates with different sound materials and the equalization produces results that closely match the target response.

For comparison purposes, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based IEEE 802.11ac PHY is used as a benchmark. Harnessing the flexibility of GFDM, we propose a novel configuration, being compliant to the IEEE 802.11ac PHY for data transmission. With that configuration, we can achieve not only lower out-of-band (OOB) emission performance but also higher spectral efficiency. By further deriving the corresponding receiver, the overall GFDM-based PHY implementation is shown to attain better frame error rates (FERs) under various modulation and coding schemes (MCSs). Moreover, at the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) where the target FER of 10% is fulfilled, GFDM can also provide higher throughput than OFDM.},

  abstract = {Joint analysis of neuroimaging data from multiple modalities has the potential to improve our understanding of brain function since each modality provides complementary information. In this paper, we address the problem of jointly analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during an auditory oddball (AOD) task with the goal of capturing neural patterns that differ between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Traditionally, fusion methods such as joint independent component analysis (jICA) have been used to jointly analyze such multi-modal neuroimaging data. However, previous jICA analyses typically analyze the EEG signal from a single electrode or concatenate signals from multiple electrodes, thus ignoring the potential multilinear structure of the EEG data, and models the data using a common mixing matrix for both modalities. In this paper, we arrange the multi-channel EEG signals as a third-order tensor with modes: subjects, time samples and electrodes, and jointly analyze the tensor with the fMRI and sMRI data, both in the form of subjects by voxels matrices, using a structure-revealing coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) model. Through this modeling approach, we (i) exploit the multilinear structure of multi-channel EEG data and (ii) capture weights for components indicative of the level of contribution from each modality. We compare the results of the structure-revealing CMTF model with those of jICA and demonstrate that, while both models capture significant distinguishing patterns between patients and controls, the structure-revealing CMTF model provides more robust activation.},

  pages = {648-652},
  abstract = {In Big Data Processing we typically face very large data sets that are highly structured. To save the computation and storage cost, it is desirable to extract the essence of the data from a reduced number of observations. One example of such a structural constraint is sparsity. If the data possesses a sparse representation in a suitable domain, it can be recovered from a small number of linear projections into a low-dimensional space. In this case, the degree of sparsity, referred to as sparsity order, is of high interest. It has recently been shown that if the measurement matrix obey certain structural constraints, one can estimate the sparsity order directly from the compressed data. The rich structure of the measurement matrix allows to rearrange the multiple-snapshot measurement vectors into a fourth-order tensor with rank equal to the desired sparsity order. In this paper, we exploit the multilinear structure of the data for accurate sparsity order estimation with improved identifiability. We discuss the choice of the parameters, i.e., the block size, block offset, and number of blocks, to maximize the sparsity order that can be inferred from a certain number of observations, and compare state-of-the-art order selection algorithms for sparsity order estimation under the chosen parameter settings. By performing an extensive campaign of simulations, we show that the discriminant function based method and the random matrix theory algorithm outperform other approaches in small and large snapshot-number scenarios, respectively.},

  abstract = {Low-rank tensor approximation algorithms are building blocks in tensor methods for signal processing. In particular, approximations of low multilinear rank (mrank) are of central importance in tensor subspace analysis. This paper proposes a novel non-iterative algorithm for computing a low-mrank approximation, termed sequential low-rank approximation and projection (SeLRAP). Our algorithm generalizes sequential rank-one approximation and projection (SeROAP), which aims at the rank-one case. For third-order mrank-(1,R,R) approximations, SeLRAP's outputs are always at least as accurate as those of previously proposed methods. Our simulation results suggest that this is actually the case for the overwhelmingly majority of random third- and fourth-order tensors and several different mranks. Though the accuracy improvement is often small, we show it can make a large difference when repeatedly computing approximations, as happens, e.g., in an iterative hard thresholding algorithm for tensor completion.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {658-662},
  abstract = {The performance in terms of minimal Bayes' error probability for detection of a random tensor is a fundamental understudied difficult problem. In this work, we assume that we observe under the alternative hypothesis a noisy rank-ñ tensor admitting a Q-order Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) with large factors of size Nq × R, i.e., for 1 ≤ q ≤ Q, R,Nq → ∞ with R1/q/Nq converges to a finite constant. The detection of the random entries of the core tensor is hard to study since an analytic expression of the error probability is not easily tractable. To mitigate this technical difficulty, the Chernoff Upper Bound (CUB) and the error exponent on the error probability are derived and studied for the considered tensor-based detection problem. These two quantities are relied to a key quantity for the considered detection problem due to its strong link with the moment generating function of the log-likelihood test. However, the tightest CUB is reached for the value, denoted by s*, which minimizes the error exponent. To solve this step, two methodologies are standard in the literature. The first one is based on the use of a costly numerical optimization algorithm. An alternative strategy is to consider the Bhattacharyya Upper Bound (BUB) for s* = 1/2. In this last scenario, the costly numerical optimization step is avoided but no guaranty exists on the optimality of the BUB. Based on powerful random matrix theory tools, a simple analytical expression of s* is provided with respect to the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and for low rank CPD. Associated to a compact expression of the CUB, an easily tractable expression of the tightest CUB and the error exponent are provided and analyzed. A main conclusion of this work is that the BUB is the tightest bound at low SNRs. At contrary, this property is no longer true for higher SNRs.},

To alleviate these limitations, tensor updating methods modify a tensor decomposition using efficient updates instead of recomputing the entire decomposition when new data becomes available. In this paper, the structure of the decomposition is exploited to achieve fast updates for the canonical polyadic decomposition whenever new slices are added to the tensor in a certain mode. A batch NLS-algorithm is adapted so that it can be used in an updating context. By only storing the old decomposition and the new slice of the tensor, the algorithm is both time- and memory efficient. Experimental results show that the proposed method is faster than batch ALS and NLS methods, while maintaining a good accuracy for the decomposition.},

However, the computational complexity of the frequency-domain driving function is demanding because of the involved Bessel functions.

Such AIRs are often considered in terms of their early and late parts, describing discrete reflections and the diffuse reverberation tail respectively. We propose an approach for constructing a sparse parametric model for the early part. The model aims at reducing the number of parameters needed to represent it and subsequently reconstruct from the representation the MA coefficients that describe it. It consists of a representation of the reflections arriving at the receiver as delayed copies of an excitation signal. The Time-Of-Arrivals of reflections are not restricted to integer sample instances and a dynamically estimated model for the excitation sound is used. We also present a corresponding parameter estimation method, which is based on regularized-regression and nonlinear optimization. The proposed method also serves as an analysis tool, since estimated parameters can be used for the estimation of room geometry, the mixing time and other channel properties. Experiments involving simulated and measured AIRs are presented, in which the AIR coefficient reconstruction-error energy does not exceed 11.4% of the energy of the original AIR coefficients. The results also indicate dimensionality reduction figures exceeding 90% when compared to a MA process representation.},

This area is surrounded by loudspeakers individually driven by their respective driving signals. Recently, the authors have published an approach for so-called Local Wave Field Synthesis which enhances the reproduction accuracy in a limited region by applying a spatial bandwidth limitation in the circular/spherical harmonics domain to the desired sound field. This paper presents an efficient time-domain realisation of the mentioned approach for 2.5-dimensional synthesis scenarios. It focuses on the model-based rendering of virtual plane waves and point sources. As an outcome, the parametric representation of the driving signals for both source types allows for the reproduction of time-varying acoustic scenarios. This also includes an adaptation to the tracked position of a moving listener. The realisation is compared with conventional Wave Field Synthesis regarding the spatial structure and spectral properties of the reproduced sound field. The results confirm the findings of the prior publication, that the reproduction accuracy can be locally improved with Local Wave Field Synthesis.},

Most ASD systems adopt outlier-detection techniques because it is difficult to collect a massive amount of anomalous sound data. To improve the performance of such outlier-detection-based ASD, it is essential to extract a set of efficient acoustic features that is suitable for identifying anomalous sounds. However, the ideal property of a set of acoustic features that maximizes ASD performance has not been clarified. By considering outlier-detection-based ASD as a statistical hypothesis test, we defined optimality as an objective function that adopts Neyman-Pearson lemma; the acoustic feature extractor is optimized to extract a set of acoustic features which maximize the true positive rate under an arbitrary false positive rate. The variational auto-encoder is applied as an acoustic feature extractor and optimized to maximize the objective function. We confirmed that the proposed method improved the F-measure score from 0.02 to 0.06 points compared to those of conventional methods, and ASD results of a stereolithography 3D-printer in a real-environment show that the proposed method is effective in identifying anomalous sounds.},

To this end, we exploit the sporadic nature of the device to station communication and formulate a sparse optimization problem as an integer program. Furthermore, we employ the convex relaxation of the discrete optimization variables in the problem in order reduce its computational complexity. A procedure to further lower the symbol detection errors is also discussed. Finally, the influence of system parameters on the performance of the proposed techniques is analysed using simulation results.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for the restoration of multilayered three-dimensional laser detection and ranging (3D Lidar) images. For multilayered targets such as semitransparent surfaces or when the transmitted light of the laser beam is incident on multiple surfaces at different depths, the returned signal may contain multiple peaks. Considering the Poisson statistics of these observations leads to a convex data fidelity term that is regularized using appropriate functions accounting for the spatial correlation between pixels and the sparse depth repartition of targets. More precisely, the spatial correlation is introduced using a convex total variation (TV) regularizer, and a collaborative sparse prior is used to introduce the depth prior knowledge. The resulting minimization problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that offers good convergence properties. The algorithm was validated using field data representing a man standing 1 meter behind camouflage, at an approximate stand-off distance of 230m from the system. The results show the benefit of the proposed strategy in that it improves the quality of the imaged objects at different depths and under reduced acquisition times.},

In this paper we develop this technique for complex domain, i.e. for application to complex-valued data. Sparsity as an approximation technique can be addressed directly to complex-valued variables or to real-valued pairs phase/amplitude and real/imaginary parts of complex-valued variables. As a result we arrive to various ways of development and obtain a set of quite different algorithms. The algorithms proposed in this paper are composed from two components: nonlocal patch-wise grouping and high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) for grouped data processing. The latter gives data adaptive complex-valued bases for complex-valued data or real-valued bases for joint processing of the pairs phase/amplitude, real/imaginary parts of complex-valued variables. Comparative study of the developed algorithms is produced in order to select the most efficient ones.},

  abstract = {Colored coded apertures (CCA) have been introduced in compressive spectral imaging (CSI) systems entailing richer coding strategies. CCA incorporate a wavelength-dependent coding procedure, which not only achieves spatial but also spectral coding in a single step. Even though the use of the CCA offers significant advantages and could also be applied to compressive spectral video sensing, this later application still exhibits diverse challenges originated by the temporal variable. The scene motion during the acquisition yields to motion artifacts such that these artifacts get aliased during the video reconstruction, damaging the entire data. As a result, multiresolution approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate the aliasing and enhance the video reconstruction. In this paper, it is proposed an algorithm to generate temporal colored coded aperture patterns that allow to sense the spatial, spectral and temporal information in an uniform way such that each spectral frame is spatially sensed at least once. In addition, it is proposed a multiresolution approach in the spectral multiplexing system allowing to extract optical flow estimates to address a higher quality reconstruction. Simulation results show an improvement up to 6 dB in terms of peak-signal to noise ratio (PSNR) in the reconstruction quality with the multiresolution approach using the designed patterns with respect to traditional random structures.},

On the target image plane, the requested view obtained via depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) is irregularly structured and has missing information due to the expansion of objects. We propose a novel framework that adopts a graph-based representation of the target view in order to interpolate the missing image pixels under sparsity priors. More specifically, we impose that the target image is reconstructed with a few atoms of a graph-based dictionary. Experimental results show that the reconstructed views have better PSNR and MSSIM quality than the ones generated within the same framework with analytical dictionaries, and are comparable to the ones reconstructed with TV regularization and linear interpolation on graphs. Visual results, however, show that our method better preserves the details and results in fewer disturbing artifacts than the other interpolation methods.},

Obviously, recognition of a subject's identity using only gait imposes limitations to the applicability of the corresponding methods whereas a method capable of recognizing the subject's identity from various activities would be much more widely applicable. In this paper, a new method for activity-based identity recognition operating on motion capture data, that can recognize the subject's identity from a variety of activities is proposed. The method combines an existing approach for feature extraction from motion capture sequences with a label propagation algorithm for classification. The method and its variants (including a novel one, that takes advantage of the fact that, in certain cases, both activity and person identity labels might exist for the labeled sequences) have been tested in two different datasets. Experimental analysis proves that the proposed approach provides very good person identity recognition results, surpassing those obtained by two other methods.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {783-787},
  abstract = {Recognizing expressions in severely demented Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is essential, since such patients have lost a substantial amount of their cognitive capacity, and some even their verbal communication ability (e.g., aphasia). This leaves patients dependent on clinical staff to assess their verbal and non-verbal language, in order to communicate important messages, as of the discomfort associated to potential complications of the AD. Such assessment classically requires the patients' presence in a clinic, and time consuming examination involving medical personnel. Thus, expression monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patients and clinical staff, which hinders among others large-scale monitoring. In this work we present a novel approach for automated recognition of facial activities and expressions of severely demented patients, where we distinguish between four activity and expression states, namely talking, singing, neutral and smiling. Our approach caters to the challenging setting of current medical recordings of music-therapy sessions, which include continuous pose variations, occlusions, camera-movements, camera-artifacts, as well as changing illumination. Additionally and importantly, the (elderly) patients exhibit generally less profound facial activities and expressions in a range of intensities and predominantly occurring in combinations (e.g., talking and smiling). Our proposed approach is based on the extension of the Improved Fisher Vectors (IFV) for videos, representing a video-sequence using both, local, as well as the related spatio-temporal features. We test our algorithm on a dataset of over 229 video sequences, acquired from 10 AD patients, with promising results, which have sparked substantial interest in the medical community. The proposed approach can play a key role in assessment of different therapy treatments, as well as in remote large-scale healthcare-frameworks.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {788-792},
  abstract = {Gesture recognition using a training set of limited size for a large vocabulary of gestures is a challenging problem in computer vision. With few examples per gesture class, researchers often employ state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This paper makes two contributions in the area of exemplar-based gesture recognition. As an alternative to DTW, we first introduce the Local Frame Match Distance (LFMD), a novel approach for matching gestures inspired by a distance measure for strings, namely Local Rank Distance (LRD). While LRD efficiently approximates the non-alignment of character n-grams between two strings, we employ LFMD to efficiently measure the non-alignment of hand locations between two video sequences. Second of all, we transform LFMD into a kernel and use it in combination with Kernel Discriminant Analysis for sign language recognition with exemplars. The empirical results indicate that our method can generally yield better performance than a state-of-the-art DTW approach on the challenging task of American Sign Language recognition, while reducing the computational time by 30%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an L1 normalized graph based dimensionality reduction method for Hyperspectral images, called as `L1-Scaling Cut' (L1-SC). The underlying idea of this method is to generate the optimal projection matrix by retaining the original distribution of the data. Though L2-norm is generally preferred for computation, it is sensitive to noise and outliers. However, L1-norm is robust to them. Therefore, we obtain the optimal projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to within-class dispersion using L1-norm. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is described to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results of the HSI classification confirm the effectiveness of the proposed L1-SC method on both noisy and noiseless data.},

  abstract = {Recent work in video compression has shown that using multiple 2D transforms instead of a single transform in order to de-correlate residuals provides better compression efficiency. These transforms are tested competitively inside a video encoder and the optimal transform is selected based on the Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) cost. However, one needs to encode a syntax to indicate the chosen transform per residual block to the decoder for successful reconstruction of the pixels. Conventionally, the transform index is binarized using fixed length coding and a CABAC context model is attached to it. In this work, we provide a novel method that utilizes Convolutional Neural Network to predict the chosen transform index from the quantized coefficient block. The prediction probabilities are used to binarize the index by employing a variable length coding instead of a fixed length coding. Results show that by employing this modified transform index coding scheme inside HEVC, one can achieve up to 0.59% BD-rate gain.},

  pages = {818-822},
  abstract = {State-space modeling of non-stationary natural signals is a notoriously difficult task. As a result of context switches, the memory depth of the model should ideally be adapted online. Stabilized linear forgetting (SLF) has been proposed as an elegant method for state-space tracking in context-switching environments. In practice, SLF leads to state and parameter estimation tasks for which no analytical solutions exist. In the literature, a few approximate solutions have been derived, making use of specific model simplifications. This paper proposes an alternative approach, in which SLF is described as an inference task on a generative probabilistic model. SLF is then executed by a variational message passing algorithm on a factor graph representation of the generative model. This approach enjoys a number of advantages relative to previous work. First, variational message passing (VMP) is an automatable procedure that adapts appropriately under changing model assumptions. This eases the search process for the best model. Secondly, VMP easily extends to estimate model parameters. Thirdly, the modular make-up of the factor graph framework allows SLF to be used as a click-on feature in a large variety of complex models. The functionality of the proposed method is verified by simulating an SLF state-space model in a context-switching data environment.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) are state-of-the-art tools for regression. Inference of GP hyperparameters is typically done by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood (ML). If the data truly follows the GP model, using the ML approach is optimal and computationally efficient. Unfortunately very often this is not case and suboptimal results are obtained in terms of prediction error. Alternative procedures such as cross-validation (CV) schemes are often employed instead, but they usually incur in high computational costs. We propose a probabilistic version of CV (PCV) based on two different model pieces in order to reduce the dependence on a specific model choice. PCV presents the benefits from both approaches, and allows us to find the solution for either the maximum a posteriori (MAP) or the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimators. Experiments in controlled situations reveal that the PCV solution outperforms ML for both estimators, and that PCV-MMSE results outperforms other traditional approaches.},

This paper proposes using ancillary statistical properties of the O-OFDM signal in order to mitigate LED nonlinearities in an unsupervised fashion. By exploring the Gaussianity of the time domain OFDM signal and the idea of distribution equalization, we propose a semi-parametric approach to blind nonlinear post-equalization for asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM) VLC systems. In addition to not requiring training data, the equalizer is robust to different LED types and it is adaptive to time-varying nonlinearities. Simulations with a realistic LED model show that the developed tool is capable of substantially mitigating the effects of nonlinear distortion on system performance.},

  abstract = {The emerging 5G mobile communication standard aims to increase the throughput and, in the same time, to considerably increase the number of users serviced concurrently (Internet of Things). The key direction for achieving these requirements is to heavily extend the use of the spatial degrees of freedom, especially in the multi-user scenarios. Multi-User Massive MIMO (MU-MIMO) is one of the key technologies that responds well to the 5G needs. However, the use of MU-MIMO in the downlink direction raises the collaborative detection problem at the user side, thus the elimination of the inter-user interference becomes necessary. The paper presents a reduced complexity linear transmitter precoding technique that cancels the inter-user interference in a downlink MU-MIMO system. The reduced complexity is achieved through re-using as many low-level operations as possible. The method is suitable for implementation on any modern processor and proven to be scalable to a Massive MIMO scenario without any loss in performance.},

Specifically, we propose to use downlink precoding combined with differential modulation (DM) to shift the complexity from the receivers to the transmitter. The block diagonalization (BD) precoding scheme is used to cancel co-channel interference (CCI) in addition to exploiting its advantage of enhancing diversity. Since the BD scheme requires channel knowledge at the transmitter, we propose to use downlink spreading along with DM, which does not require channel knowledge neither at the transmitter nor at the receivers. The orthogonal spreading (OS) scheme is employed in order to separate the data streams of different users. As a space time block code, we use the Alamouti code that can be encoded/decoded using DM thereby eliminating the need for channel knowledge at the receiver. The proposed schemes yield low complexity transceivers while providing good performance. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

The PA power efficiency decreases but simulation results show that the same performance in terms of bit-error-ratio (BER) can be achieved with less transmitted power and less PA power consumption. We propose a linear and a nonlinear precoder design to mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI) under the constraint of a maximal instantaneous per-antenna peak power.},

  abstract = {We study joint estimation of the channel impulse response (CIR) and of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) for linear channels in which both the CIR and the noise statistics vary periodically in time. This model corresponds to interference-limited communications as well as to power line communication and doubly selective channels. We first consider the joint maximum likelihood estimator (JMLE) for the CIR and the CFO and show it has a high computational complexity and relatively low spectral efficiency. This motivates the derivation of two estimation schemes with higher spectral efficiency and lower computational complexity compared to the JMLE, obtained by exploiting both the periodicity of the channel and the fact that, typically, the delay-Doppler spreading function of the CIR is approximately sparse, without requiring a-priori knowledge of the sparsity pattern. The proposed estimation schemes are numerically tested and the results demonstrate that substantial benefits can be obtained by properly accounting for the approximate sparsity and periodicity in the design of the estimation scheme.},

To achieve high speed communications, multi-carrier modulations have been adopted both for the downlink and the uplink. In the LTE downlink, OFDMA (the multi-user version of OFDM) has been chosen. The LTE uplink uses instead SC-FDMA modulation, an OFDM alternative. In this work, the use of CB-FMT, jointly with SC-FDMA, is analyzed in the high mobility scenario. Numerical results show that CB-FMT outperforms SC-FDMA in several cases. Thus, an adaptive implementation architecture that allows to flexibly choose the modulation scheme is proposed to maximize the achievable rate. Furthermore, for compliance with existing LTE parameters, frequency domain zero padded CB-FMT is proposed, and the problem of designing optimal capacity wise waveforms is considered.},

  pages = {883-887},
  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an emerging technology for future wireless networks, scaling up conventional MIMO to an unprecedented number of antennas at base stations. Such a large antenna array has the potential to make the system achieve high channel capacity and spectral efficiency, but it also leads to high cost in terms of hardware complexity. In this paper, we consider a finite dimensional channel model in which finite distinct directions are applied with M angular bins. In massive multi-user MIMO systems, a hybrid precoding method is proposed to reduce the required number of radio frequency (RF) chains at the base station, employing a single antenna per mobile station. The proposed precoder is partitioned into a high-dimensional RF precoder and a low-dimensional baseband precoder. The RF precoder is designed to obtain power gain with phase-only control and the baseband precoder is designed to facilitate multi-stream processing. For realistic scenarios, we consider the situation where the RF phase control is quantized up to B bits of precision. Furthermore, an upper bound on spectral efficiency is derived with the proposed precoding scheme. The simulation results show that hybrid precoding achieves desirable performance in terms of spectral efficiency, which approaches the performance of zero-forcing precoding.},

However for transient signals the reassignment needs to be adapted in order to achieve good localisation of the signal components. One approach is to scale the reassignment. This paper shows that by adapting the shape of the time window used with the spectrogram and by scaling the reassignment, perfect localisation can be achieved for a transient signal component. It is also shown that without matching the shape of the window, perfect localisation is not achieved. This is used to both identify the time-frequency centres of components in a multi-component signal, and to detect the shapes of the signal components. The scaled reassigned spectrogram with the matching shape window is shown to be able to resolve close components and works well for multi-components signals with noise. An echolocation signal from a beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) provides an example of how the method performs on a measured signal.},

The formulation also allows for putting emphasis on a particular set of parameters of interest by scaling the optimization problem in such a way that the bound to be minimized becomes more sensitive to these parameters. For the case of imprecise a priori knowledge of these parameters, we present a framework for customizing the sampling scheme to take such uncertainty into account.

Recently, drones with high resolution cameras have made it possible to perform overhead surveillance of critical spaces. However, images obtained in these conditions may not contain enough body features to allow conventional biometric recognition. This paper introduces a novel gait recognition system which uses the shadows cast by users, when available. It includes two main contributions: (i) a method for shadow segmentation, which analyzes the orientation of the silhouette contour to identify the feet position along time, in order to separate the body and shadow silhouettes connected at such positions; (ii) a method that normalizes the segmented shadow silhouettes, by applying a transformation derived from optimizing the low rank textures of a gait texture image, to compensate for changes in view and shadow orientation. The normalized shadow silhouettes can then undergo a gait recognition algorithm, which in this paper relies on the computation of a gait energy image, combined with linear discriminant analysis for user recognition. The proposed system outperforms the available state-of-the-art, being robust to changes in acquisition viewpoints.},

  abstract = {In the past, many efforts have been directed to develop biometrie template protection schemes to guard bio-metric reference data, i.e. templates. One fundamental premise in the design of such schemes is that the average entropy of the templates should be maximised in order to improve the level of protection. In parallel, several works have addressed the difficult problem of measuring the average entropy of biometric characteristics. However, the impact of the correlation present in different regions of a single biometric characteristic (e.g., left and right part of the face) or within two instances of a single subject (e.g., left and right palmprints) on the joint entropy of a multi-biometric template has been overlooked os far. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a way to measure such correlation from an information theoretical perspective. We then apply the proposed measure to a particular case study based on periocular biometrics, using the MobBIO database. The results show that up to 70% of the information comprised in both periocular regions of a given subject is correlated. Finally, we analyse the implications of such average mutual information loss on biometric template protection schemes.},

In this paper, we present ASePPI, an Adaptive Scrambling enabling Privacy Protection and Intelligibility. It operates in the DCT domain within the H.264 standard. For each residual block of the luminance channel inside the region of interest, we encrypt the coefficients. Whereas encrypted coefficients appear as noise in the protected image, the DC value is dedicated to restore some of the original information. Thus, the proposed approach automatically adapts the level of protection according to the resolution of the region of interest. Comparing to existing methods, our framework provides better privacy protection with some flexibilities on the appearance of the protected version yielding better visibility of the scene for monitoring. Moreover, the impact on the source coding stream is negligible. Indeed, the results demonstrate a slight decrease in the quality of the reconstructed images and a small percentage of bits overhead.},

Enormous research has been delved into in recent years in order to fully sequence and understand the genome. Personalised medicine, patient response to treatments and relationships between specific genes and certain characteristics such as phenotypes and diseases, are positive impacts of studying the genome, just to mention a few. The sensitivity, longevity and non-modifiable nature of genetic data make it even more interesting, consequently, the security and privacy for the storage and processing of genomic data beg for attention. A common activity carried out by geneticists is the association analysis between allele-allele, or even a genetic locus and a disease. We demonstrate the use of cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption schemes and multiparty computations, how such analysis can be carried out in a privacy friendly manner. We compute a 3 × 3 contingency table, and then, genome analyses algorithms such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures, all on the encrypted domain. Our computation guarantees privacy of the genome data under our security settings, and provides up to 98.4% improvement, compared to an existing solution.},

They also reveal that such cross-genre setups evoke specific types of error (predicting the relative or parallel minor).

In this paper, music features that contribute to music complexity are investigated and related to a music preprocessing scheme for cochlear implants, in which a complexity reduction is achieved in an attempt to increase music appreciation. First, a complexity rating experiment is performed with pop/rock music excerpts and a linear regression model is developed to describe this (subjective) music complexity based on different music features. Subsequently, this model is used to validate the complexity reduction in the music preprocessing scheme and to provide an indication for the preferred setting for the balance between vocals/bass/drums and the other instruments for cochlear implant subjects.},

It employs a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis-modify-synthesis loop and is typically used for time-scaling of signals by means of using different time steps for STFT analysis and synthesis. The main challenge of PV used for that purpose is the correction of the STFT phase. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for phase correction based on phase gradient estimation and its integration. The method does not require explicit peak picking and tracking nor does it require detection of transients and their separate treatment. Yet, the method does not suffer from the typical phase vocoder artifacts even for extreme time stretching factors.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {981-985},
  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to stereophonic music separation based on Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF). Stereophonic music is roughly divided into two types; recorded music or synthesized music, which we focus on synthesized one in this paper. Synthesized music signals are often generated as linear combinations of many individual source signals with their mixing gains (i.e., time-invariant amplitude scaling) to each channel signal. Therefore, the synthesized stereophonic music separation is the underdetermined source separation problem where phase components are not helpful for the separation. NTF is one of the effective techniques to handle this problem, decomposing amplitude spectrograms of the stereo channel music signal into basis vectors and activations of individual music source signals and their corresponding mixing gains. However, it is essentially difficult to obtain sufficient separation performance in this separation problem as available acoustic cues for separation are limited. To address this issue, we propose a cepstrum regularization method for NTF-based stereo channel separation. The proposed method makes the separated music source signals follow the corresponding Gaussian mixture models of individual music source signals, which are trained in advance using their available samples. An experimental evaluation using real music signals is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both supervised and unsupervised separation frameworks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvements in separation performance in both frameworks.},

In particular, we investigate the use of different temporal subsampling strategies, and show that they can be used to effectively trade computational workload against classification accuracy.

The Clarke transform is commonly employed to transform the three real voltages to in-phase and quadrature components that are combined to form a complex exponential, the frequency of which can then be estimated. The imbalance between the voltages in an unbalanced system results in significant performance degradation. We address this problem by generalising the Clarke transformation to the case where the voltages are not equal. We then propose a new simple yet accurate algorithm for the estimation of the frequency.

While traditional methods for protection and network managements rely upon processing of these signals at low speed, high-frequency processing of the raw current and voltage signals can unveil information about the type of electrical load in the networks. In particular, the common case of three-phase induction machines is considered in this paper. Motor parameters are instrumental information for control, monitoring and diagnostic. A classical approach is to measure motor parameters using off-line dedicated measurements. In this paper, we propose a method for motor parameters estimation from electrical measurements during motor start-up. Given samples of current and voltage signals during motor start-up, the model parameters are identified using classical non-linear system identification tools. While the classical theory is developed using current sensors, in this paper the method is extended to a common type of industrial current sensors, i.e., Rogowski coil sensors, and signal processing methods are presented to overcome the non-ideality caused by this type of sensors. Numerical tests performed on real data show that effective motor parameters identification can be achieved from the raw current and voltage measurements.},

This joint team has developed a software, called the Joint Exploration Model (JEM) which outperforms by over 25% the HEVC standard. The transform step in JEM consists in Adaptive Multiple Transforms (AMT) and Non-Separable Secondary Transforms (NSST) which are designed and adapted to the intra-coding modes. In inter-coding, only the AMT is allowed and it is restricted to a single set of five transforms. In this paper, adaptive transforms schemes suitable for inter-predicted residuals are designed and proposed to improve the coding efficiency. Two configurations are evaluated for the proposed designs, providing an average bitrate saving of roughly 1% over HEVC with unchanged decoding time.},

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between subjective video quality and energy consumption in an HEVC decoder. By reducing the computational complexity of the decoder, drastic energy savings can be achieved without affecting the visual quality. In this paper, two computation methods and several filter configurations are tested. Results show that at least 10% of energy savings are obtained with the same subjective perceived quality. In addition, objective measurements have shown that only a slight quality degradation has been noticed.},

  abstract = {The 3D extension of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard achieves large compression rates thanks to the addition of several tools to encode multiview and depth information on top of those available in HEVC. The use of such tools incur in a very large computational demand, which can be a serious problem in power and computationally-constrained devices and applications. However, not all information contained in an image is fundamental to the viewer, so that different levels of computational effort can be employed when encoding different image regions. The Region of Interest (ROI) concept is used in this work to classify each Coding Unit (CU) as foreground, heterogeneous background and homogeneous background. Then, a simplified encoding process is employed in those regions classified as homogeneous background, terminating earlier the partitioning process in texture CUs, while still still performing the regular decisions in areas classified as ROI. Experimental results show an average reduction of 22.6% in computational complexity for texture coding with negligible or non-perceived image quality degradation.},

For this purpose a set of features characterizing a typical flight is decided, supposing that these features affect the price of an air ticket. The features are applied to eight state of the art machine learning (ML) models, used to predict the air tickets prices, and the performance of the models is compared to each other. Along with the prediction accuracy of each model, this paper studies the dependency of the accuracy on the feature set used to represent an airfare. For the experiments a novel dataset consisting of 1814 data flights of the Aegean Airlines for a specific international destination (from Thessaloniki to Stuttgart) is constructed and used to train each ML model. The derived experimental results reveal that the ML models are able to handle this regression problem with almost 88% accuracy, for a certain type of flight features.},

The problem of hand gesture recognition consists of identifying, at any moment, a given gesture performed by the hand. In this work, we propose a new model for hand gesture recognition in real time. The input of this model is the surface electromyography measured by the commercial sensor the Myo armband placed on the forearm. The output is the label of the gesture executed by the user at any time. The proposed model is based on the Λ-nearest neighbor and dynamic time warping algorithms. This model can learn to recognize any gesture of the hand. To evaluate the performance of our model, we measured and compared its accuracy at recognizing 5 classes of gestures to the accuracy of the proprietary system of the Myo armband. As a result of this evaluation, we determined that our model performs better (86% accurate) than the Myo system (83%).},

  abstract = {The problem of detecting misinformation and fake content on social media is gaining importance with the increase in popularity of these social media platforms. Researchers have addressed this content analysis problem using machine learning tools with innovations in feature engineering as well as algorithm design. However, most of the machine learning approaches use a conventional classification setting, involving training a classifier on a set of features. In this work, we propose a fusion of a pairwise ranking approach and a classification system in detecting tweets with misinformation that include multimedia content. Pairwise ranking allows comparison between two objects and returns a preference score for the first object in the pair in comparison to the second object. We design a ranking system to determine the legitimacy score for a tweet with reference to another tweet from the same topic of discussion (as hashtagged on Twitter), thereby allowing a contextual comparison. Finally, we incorporate the ranking system outputs within the classification system. The proposed fusion obtains an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 83.5% in classifying misinforming tweets against genuine tweets, a significant improvement over a classification only baseline system (UAR: 80.1%).},

  abstract = {Many optimization problems in communications and signal processing can be formulated as rank-one constrained optimization problems. This has motivated the development of methods to solve such problem in specific scenarios. However, due to the non-convex nature of the rank-one constraint, limited progress has been made in solving generic rank-one constrained optimization problems. In particular, the problem of efficiently finding a locally optimal solution to a generic rank-one constrained problem remains open. This paper focuses on solving general rank-one constrained problems via relaxation techniques. However, instead of dropping the rank-one constraint completely as is done in traditional rank-one relaxation methods, a novel algorithm that gradually relaxes the rank-one constraint, termed the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm, is proposed. Compared with previous algorithms, the SROCR algorithm can solve general rank-one constrained problems, and can find feasible solutions with favorable complexity.},

The estimation of the VARMA model parameters are performed with Maximum Likelihood Estimators in Gaussian and non-Gaussian environment. These two joint estimates of the spatial and temporal covariance matrices leads to build Adaptive Radar Detectors, like Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter (ANMF).

  abstract = {Various works have been carried out about the Jeffrey's divergence (JD) which is the symmetric version of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. An expression of the JD for Gaussian processes can be deduced from the definition of the KL divergence and the expression of the Gaussian-multivariate distributions of k-dimensional random vectors. It depends on the k × k Toeplitz covariance matrices of the stationary processes. However, the resulting computational cost may be high as these matrices must be inverted and it is all the higher as k increases. To circumvent this problem, a recursive expression can be obtained for real 1st-order autoregressive (AR) processes. When they are disturbed by additive uncorrelated white noises, we showed that when k becomes large, the derivative of the JD with respect to k tends to be constant. This constant is sufficient to compare the noisy AR processes. In this paper, we propose to extend our work to AR moving-average (MA) processes with one AR term and one MA term. Some examples illustrate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {Clock frequency estimation is a key issue in many signal processing applications, e.g. network clock estimation in wireless sensor networks. In wireless systems or harsh environments, it is likely that clock events can be missed and, therefore, the observed process has to be treated as a sparse periodic process. To parameterize the clock, current research is applying periodogram estimators at a complexity of at least O(N log N). We introduce a highly accurate iterative frequency estimator for pulse signals with low computational complexity. An unbiased frequency estimator is presented with a complexity of O(N). Furthermore the mean square error (MSE), which is proportional to O(N-3) is derived and it is shown by theory and simulation that this estimator performs as well as periodogram based methods. The work concludes with simulations on sparse and non-sparse processes including a discussion of the application of the method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a matrix polynomial whose coefficients are matrices is first defined. Its predictive model, called as the Matrix Polynomial Predictive Model (MPPM), is then derived. When the loading matrices of a decomposed tensor in the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) are replaced by the predicted ones of the MPPM, a new ALS algorithm with the MPPM (ALS-MPPM) is proposed. Analyses show that the convergent rate of the proposed ALS-MPPM is closely related to the degree of the matrix polynomial. Namely, when an accelerative convergence rate is expected, the polynomial with a high degree is preferred. Although a high degree means a high possibility of prediction failure, a simple solution can be used to handle such failure. Moreover, the relationship between our ALS-MPPM and the existing ALS-based algorithms is also analyzed. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed ALS-MPPM outperforms the reported ALS-based algorithms in the literature while the analytical results are verified.},

More particularly, we show that the ratios between the variance of the additive white noise and the variance of the AR-process driving process on the one hand, and the sum of the ratios between the SCE process power and the AR-process PSD at the normalized angular frequencies on the other hand, has a strong impact on the JD. The 2-norm of the AR-parameter has also an influence. Illustrations confirm the theoretical part.},

Over short durations a signal's frequency content is likely to contain a limited number of effective frequencies and a sparse regeneration approach can be advantageous as an extrapolating mechanism. An enlarged number of samples can thus yield spectrograms with high frequency resolution. The capabilities of the proposed techniques are demonstrated on several synthetic and real data signals.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation (NAEC) can be mainly addressed by solving two different sub-problems: the estimation of the acoustic impulse response and the modeling of the nonlinearities rebounding in it, mostly caused by the electroacoustic chain. Both the modeling processes share an important characteristic: the majority of the parameters to be estimated are very close to zero, with only a small fraction of them having non-negligible magnitude. In this paper, a novel NAEC model is proposed taking into account both the above sub-problems under a joint optimization problem. In particular, the proposed model involves two separate and parallel filters, one mainly focusing on the estimation of the acoustic impulse response (AIR) and the other one aiming at the nonlinear modeling. In order to optimize the modeling processes, both the filters are adapted by using a joint proportionate algorithm. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in NAEC problems.},

  abstract = {Hearing prostheses have built-in algorithms to perform acoustic noise reduction and improve speech intelligibility. However, in a multi-speaker scenario the noise reduction algorithm has to determine which speaker the listener is focusing on, in order to enhance it while suppressing the other interfering sources. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to detect auditory attention using electroencephalography (EEG). In this paper, we use multi-channel Wiener filters (MWFs), to filter out each speech stream from the speech mixtures in the micro-phones of a binaural hearing aid, while also reducing background noise. From the demixed and denoised speech streams, we extract envelopes for an EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) algorithm. The AAD module can then select the output of the MWF corresponding to the attended speaker. We evaluate our algorithm in a two-speaker scenario in the presence of babble noise and compare it to a previously proposed algorithm. Our algorithm is observed to provide speech envelopes that yield better AAD accuracies, and is more robust to variations in speaker positions and diffuse background noise.},

The dictionary enables online DOA detection, which in turn enables online diarization. Here we describe data-driven and physical model-based designs of the dictionary. Experiments on a meeting dataset showed that a physical model-based dictionary gave a word error rate (WER) of 24.9 %, which is close to that for the best-performing data-driven dictionary (24.1%). Therefore, the former has a significant advantage over the latter that it allows us to bypass the cumbersome measurement of training data without much degrading the performance of the automatic speech recognition (ASR).},

ILRMA is a state-of-the-art BSS technique that utilizes the statistical independence between low-rank matrix spectrogram models, which are estimated by nonnegative matrix factorization. In conventional frequency-domain BSS, the modeling error of a mixing system increases when the window length is too short, and the accuracy of statistical estimation decreases when the window length is too long. Therefore, the optimal window length is determined by both the reverberation time and the number of time frames. However, unlike classical BSS methods such as ICA and IVA, ILRMA enables the full modeling of spectrograms, which may improve the robustness to a decrease in the number of frames in a longer-window case. To confirm this hypothesis, the optimal window length for ILRMA is experimentally investigated, and the difference between the performances of ILRMA and conventional BSS is discussed.},

During the past few years, an explosion of research in probabilistic CA has been witnessed, with the introduction of several novel methods (e.g., Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis, Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA), Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis). PLDA constitutes one of the most widely used supervised CA techniques which is utilized in order to extract suitable, distinct subspaces by exploiting the knowledge of data annotated in terms of different labels. Nevertheless, an inherent difficulty in PLDA variants is the proper initialization of the parameters in order to avoid ending up in poor local maxima. In this light, we propose a novel method to initialize the parameters in PLDA in a consistent and robust way. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated via a set of experiments on the modified XM2VTS database, which is provided by the authors of the original PLDA model.},

  abstract = {Parametrisation of the shape of deformable objects is of paramount importance in many computer vision applications. Many state-of-the-art statistical deformable models perform landmark localisation via optimising an objective function over a certain parametrisation of the object's shape. Arguably, the most popular way is by employing statistical techniques. The points of shape samples of an object lie in a 2D lattice and they are normally represented by concatenating the 2D coordinates into a vector. As the 2D coordinates can be naturally represented as a complex number, in this paper we study statistical complex number representations of an object's shape. In particular, we show that the real representation provides a similar statistical prior as the widely linear complex model, while the circular complex representation results in a much more condensed encoding.},

  abstract = {Video capturing using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles provides cinematographers with impressive shots but requires very adept handling of both the drone and the camera. Deep Learning techniques can be utilized in this process to facilitate the video shooting process by allowing the drone to analyze its input and make intelligent decisions regarding its flight path. Fast and accurate on-board face detection for example can lead the drone towards capturing opportunistic shots, e.g., close ups of persons of importance. However, the constraints imposed by the drones' on-board processing power and memory prohibit the utilization of computationally expensive models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight two-stream fully Convolutional Neural Network for face detection, capable of detecting faces in various settings in real-time using the limited processing power Unmanned Aerial Vehicles possess.},

  abstract = {Ellipse fitting is widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms such as object segmentation and pupil/eye tracking. Generally, ellipse fitting is finding the best ellipse parameters that can be fitted on a set of data points, which are usually noisy and contain outliers. The algorithms of fitting the best ellipse should be both suitable for real-time applications and robust against noise and outliers. In this paper, we introduce a new method of ellipse fitting which is based on sparsity of outliers and robust Huber's data fitting measure. We will see that firstly this approach is theoretically better justified than a state-of-the-art ellipse fitting algorithm based on sparse representation. Secondly, simulation results show that it provides a better robustness against outliers compared to some previous ellipse fitting approaches, while being even faster.},

  abstract = {Sampling from multi-dimensional and complex distributions is still a challenging issue for the signal processing community. In this research area, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) schemes have been proposed several years ago, using the target distribution geometry to perform efficient sampling. More recently, a non-smooth HMC (ns-HMC) scheme has been proposed to generalize HMC for distributions having non-smooth energy functions. This new scheme relies on the use of a proximity operator, which cannot be explicitly calculated for a large class of energy functions. We propose in this paper a fast and more general ns-HMC scheme that can be applied to any energy function by using a Bayesian calculation of the proximity operator, which makes the proposed scheme applicable to any energy function. Moreover, the proposed scheme relies on an interesting property of the proximity operator avoiding heavy calculations at each sampling step. The proposed scheme is tested on different sampling examples involving ℓp and total variation energy functions.},

This paper proposes an efficient method in designing two-dimensional planar arrays of first order microphones that are capable of completely capturing three-dimensional (3D) spatial exterior soundfields. First order microphones are utilised within the array for measurements of pressure gradients, allowing the microphone array to capture soundfield components that conventional planar omni-directional microphone arrays are unable to detect. While spherical microphone arrays are capable of detecting all soundfield components, they have drawbacks in feasibility due to their 3D geometric configuration. The proposed planar array of first-order microphone provides the same functionality as a large spherical array which needs to encompass all sound sources while having a scalable geometry that lies purely in a two-dimensional horizontal plane. Simulations show the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed microphone array design in capturing a fully developed exterior soundfield.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new TDOA estimation based on phase-voting cross correlation and circular standard deviation. Based on phase delay and kernel function, the proposed method generates a probability density function (PDF) of TDOA for each frequency bin. TDOA estimate is determined by voting the PDFs generated for all frequency bins. Peak positions of the bin-wise PDFs for the target signal are concentrated only at the target time difference because peak positions for the noise totally differ among bins and periodicity of peaks depends on frequency. Therefore, by voting the PDFs for all frequency bins, the peak position for the target can be easily identified. The kernel width of PDF is determined by circular standard deviation of cross spectral phase for each frequency bin. This width control enhances peaks of PDFs for high SNR frequency bins since phases for high SNR bins are more stable than those for low ones. Evaluation with ship and drone sounds shows that the RMSE of TDOA estimation by the proposed method reaches 0.37 times that by GCC-PHAT.},

In the state-of-the-art Direct Path Dominance (DPD)-MUSIC, the covariance matrix, used as the input to MUSIC, is calculated using only the TF bins over a local TF region where only a SS is dominant. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to MUSIC in which all the SS-dominant TF bins for each speaker across TF domain are globally used to improve the quality of covariance matrix for MUSIC. Our recently proposed Multi-Source Estimation Consistency (MSEC) technique, which exploits the consistency of initial DOA estimates within a time frame based on adaptive clustering, is used to estimate the SS-dominant TF bins for each speaker. The simulation using spherical microphone array shows that our proposed MSEC-MUSIC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art DPD-MUSIC with less than 6.5° mean estimation error and strong robustness to widely varying source separation for up to 5 sources in the presence of realistic reverberation and sensor noise.},

We evaluate the proposed model by comparing analytic TDOAs to measured TDOAs extracted from impulse responses (IR) of a rigid sphere (r = 7.5cm). The proposed method achieves over 40% relative improvement in TDOA accuracy in comparison to free-field propagation and TDOAs extracted from analytic IRs of a spherical microphone array provide an additional 10% improvement. We test the proposed model for the application of source direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using steered response power (SRP) with real reverberant recordings of moving speech sources. All tested methods perform equally well in noise-free scenario, while the proposed model and simulated IRs improve over free-field assumption in low SNR conditions.

A conventional method based on the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has been proposed for audio recovery. However, the conventional method has a low performance for sounds of machineries because, sounds of machineries tend to be not highly sparse, and the reconstruction performance of OMP decreases extremely if the signal is not sufficiently sparse. To solve the problem of the conventional method, the proposed method is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for Group Lasso combined with the Gabor dictionary. While OMP's performance decreases with the number of nonzero elements, the proposed method shows a better robustness to variations in sparsity and outputs a reasonable result in a few tens of iterations. Those features among others make the algorithm a reliable solution which offers a better trade-off between accuracy and processing time compared to the conventional method.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNN) have recently been shown to give state-of-the-art performance in monaural speech enhancement. However in the DNN training process, the perceptual difference between different components of the DNN output is not fully exploited, where equal importance is often assumed. To address this limitation, we have proposed a new perceptually-weighted objective function within a feedforward DNN framework, aiming to minimize the perceptual difference between the enhanced speech and the target speech. A perceptual weight is integrated into the proposed objective function, and has been tested on two types of output features: spectra and ideal ratio masks. Objective evaluations for both speech quality and speech intelligibility have been performed. Integration of our perceptual weight shows consistent improvement on several noise levels and a variety of different noise types.},

  abstract = {There are many combined signal processing applications such as the joint processing of EEG (Electroencephalogram) and MEG (Magnetoencephalogram) data that can benefit from coupled CP (Canonical Polyadic) tensor decompositions. The coupled CP decomposition jointly decomposes tensors that have at least one factor matrix in common. The C-SECSI (Coupled - Semi-Algebraic framework for approximate CP decomposition via Simultaneaous matrix diagonalization) framework provides a semi-algebraic solution for the coupled CP decomposition of noise corrupted low-rank tensors. The C-SECSI framework efficiently computes the factor matrices even in ill-posed scenarios with an adjustable complexity-accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we present a reliability test for the C-SECSI framework that can improve the model order estimation. Moreover, we analyse the photic driving effect from simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data using the C-SECSI framework. The EEG and MEG data used in the analysis are obtained by stimulating volunteers with flickering light at different frequencies that are multiples of the individual alpha frequency of each volunteer.},

However, these W-HRV methods come with a variety of tradeoffs that motivate the development of alternative methods in stress sensing. We compare our method of using HeartBeat Morphology (HBM) features for stress sensing to the traditional W-HRV method for feature extraction. In order to adequately evaluate these methods we conduct a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to elicit stress in a group of 13 firefighters while recording their ECG, actigraphy, and psychological self-assessment measures. We utilize the data from this experiment to analyze both feature extraction methods in terms of computational complexity, detection resolution performance, and event localization performance. Our results show that each method has an ideal niche for its use in stress sensing. HBM features tend to be more effective in an online, stress detection context. W-HRV shows to be more suitable for offline post processing to determine the exact localization of the stress event.},

In this paper, a sequential technique was investigated. Detection was based on a variant of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, the so-called Page-Hinkley algorithm showing optimal results for detecting abrupt changes in the mean of a normal random signal. Experiments on simulated and real datasets showed the good performance of the method in terms of sensitivity and false detection rate.

We first show that the cyclostationarity property of the ECG signal disturbed by the MHD effect can be quantified by means of cyclic spectral analysis. Then, this information is forwarded as input to a cyclostationary source extraction algorithm applied to a set of ECG recordings acquired inside the MRI scanner in a Feet first (Ff) and a Head first (Hf) positions. Finally, detection of the R-peaks in the estimated cyclostationary signal completes the proposed procedure. Validation of the method is performed by comparing the estimated with clinical R-peaks annotations provided with the real world dataset.

  title = {Automatic characterization of sleep need dissipation using a single hidden layer neural network},
  year = {2017},
  pages = {1305-1308},
  abstract = {In the two process sleep model, the rate of sleep need dissipation is proportional to slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power in the 0.5 to 4 Hz band). The dynamics of sleep need dissipation are characterized by two parameters (the initial sleep need So and the decay rate γ) that can be calculated from SWA values in NREM sleep. The goal in this paper is to use a neural network classifier to automatically detect NREM sleep and estimate Ŝo and γ̂ using a single EEG signal that is captured during sleep at home. The data from twenty subjects (4 sleep nights per subject) was used in this research. The neural network architecture was optimized using as training and validation sets the EEG sleep data from a previous study. Given the nature of the model, only three stages were considered (NREM, REM, and WAKE). The classification accuracy characterized by the Kappa value achieved in this study dataset was 0.63 (substantial agreement with manual staging) and the specificity/sensitivity for NREM detection were 0.87 and 0.8 respectively. The higher specificity in NREM detection led to systematic So underestimation (i.e. So > Ŝo) and 7 overestimation (i.e. γ <; γ̂). However the variability of the, Ŝo and γ̂ across nights of the same subject is lower compared to the variability of Ŝ0 and γ̂ This shows that using automatic staging to characterize sleep need dissipation leads to capturing the most specific and less variable EEG segments that contribute to SWA. This is suitable to characterize sleep need outside sleep lab settings (e.g. at home) that cannot be controlled to the same extent as sleep lab studies.},

  pages = {1309-1313},
  abstract = {Least angle regression (LARS) by Efron et al. (2004) is a novel method for constructing the piece-wise linear path of Lasso solutions. For several years, it remained also as the de facto method for computing the Lasso solution before more sophisticated optimization algorithms preceded it. LARS method has recently again increased its popularity due to its ability to find the values of the penalty parameters, called knots, at which a new parameter enters the active set of non-zero coefficients. Significance test for the Lasso by Lockhart et al. (2014), for example, requires solving the knots via the LARS algorithm. Elastic net (EN), on the other hand, is a highly popular extension of Lasso that uses a linear combination of Lasso and ridge regression penalties. In this paper, we propose a new novel algorithm, called pathwise (PW-)LARS-EN, that is able to compute the EN knots over a grid of EN tuning parameter α values. The developed PW-LARS-EN algorithm decreases the EN tuning parameter and exploits the previously found knot values and the original LARS algorithm. A covariance test statistic for the Lasso is then generalized to the EN for testing the significance of the predictors. Our simulation studies validate the fact that the test statistic has an asymptotic Exp(1) distribution.},

It was designed to enable cost-effective 3-D imaging and tracking of people in an indoor environment. This algorithm is able to image both sparse and cluttered environments, through the use of wavelet transforms and compressive sensing techniques. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that it enables the use of much sparser antenna arrays than is possible with the traditional range-migration algorithm, reducing the cost of microwave imaging systems. Experiments show that the compressive sensing algorithm produced high quality 3-D images using antenna arrays that are 90 to 96% sparse. This reduces the cost of the antenna array by a factor of 10 to 25, when compared to traditional dense arrays, without a loss in image resolution.},

The system is modeled by a linear equation with the assumption that the signal energy per measurement decreases linearly and the noise energy per measurement increases approximately linearly with the increasing of the number of measurements. Thus the SNR decreases quadratically with the number of measurements. This model suggests an optimal operation point different from the common wisdom where more measurements always mean better performance. Our analysis shows that there is an optimal number of measurements, neither too few nor too many, to minimize the mean-squared error of the estimate. The analysis is based on a state evolution technique which is proposed for the approximate message passing algorithm. We consider the Gaussian, Bernoulli-Gaussian and least-favorite distributions in both real and complex domains. Numerical results justify the correctness of our analysis.},

  abstract = {Distributed compressive sensing is a framework considering jointly sparsity within signal ensembles along with multiple measurement vectors (MMVs). The current theoretical bound of performance for MMVs, however, is derived to be the same with that for single MV (SMV) because the characteristics of signal ensembles are ignored. In this work, we introduce a new factor called {"}Euclidean distances between signals{"} for the performance analysis of a deterministic signal model under MMVs framework. We show that, by taking the size of signal ensembles into consideration, MMVs indeed exhibit better performance than SMV. Although our concept can be broadly applied to CS algorithms with MMVs, the case study conducted on a well-known greedy solver, called simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), will be explored in this paper. We show that the performance of SOMP, when incorporated with our concept by modifying the steps of support detection and signal estimations, will be improved remarkably, especially when the Euclidean distances between signals are short. The performance of modified SOMP is verified to meet our theoretical prediction.},

One of the main requirements of compressive sensing is the sparsity of the class of signals of interest in some basis. A method to construct a sparsifying basis for a class of signals using information theoretic measures is proposed in this paper. The algorithm constructs the sparsifying basis from a known non-sparsifying basis by concentrating the probability distribution of the basis in the representation of a class of signals. Simulation studies using speech and image signals confirm that the basis constructed using the proposed method results in an improved sparsity of the signals with thresholded coefficients but without degrading the signal quality.},

In some real-life applications, portable personal authentication systems with high accuracy and speed efficiency are required. This paper presents an embedded palmprint recognition solution based on the multispectral image modality.

  abstract = {The analysis of finite wordlength effects in linear digital networks requires specifying the exact order in which all the internal computations are performed, as well as the type and resolution of all the quantizers. Popular digital filter descriptions (difference equations, transfer function, state space representation, etc.) are unable to provide a bit-true description valid for any filter structure, thus preventing most of the results in the literature from being truly reproducible. Furthermore, the quantizers are often not properly described. In this work, we introduce a novel and compact framework to describe unambiguously any single-input single-output (SISO) linear digital network. The proposed approach is simple, efficient and guarantees the reproducibility of the results obtained for any network by allowing us to describe in detail the data flow as well as the quantization of all the coefficients and operations performed. An example of a third order Butterworth filter with four different implementations is provided to show the descriptive power and flexibility of the proposed approach.},

This work introduces two main contributions: the application of entropy measures in condition monitoring and the classification of real field EMI captured signals. The two simple and low dimension features are fed to a Multi-Class Support Vector Machine for the classification of different discharge sources contained in the EMI signals. Classification was performed to distinguish between the conditions observed within each site and between all sites. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach separated and identified the discharge sources successfully.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to present a methodology for health monitoring wind turbine gearboxes using vibration data. Monitoring of wind turbines is a crucial aspect of maintenance optimisation that is required for wind farms to remain sustainable and profitable. The proposed methodology performs spectral line analysis and extracts health features from harmonic vibration spectra, at various time instants prior to a gear tooth failure. For this, the tachometer signal of the shaft is used to reconstruct the signal in the angular domain. The diagnosis approach is applied to detect gear faults affecting the intermediate stage of the gearbox. The health features extracted show the gradient deterioration of the gear at progressive time instants before the catastrophic failure. A classification model is trained for fault recognition and prognosis of time before failure. The effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnostic and prognostic approach has been tested with industrial data. The above will lay the groundwork of a robust framework for the early automatic detection of emerging gearbox faults. This will lead to minimisation of wind turbine downtime and increased revenue through operational enhancement.},

Under the white noise assumption, the covariance matrix of the noise subspace components of the observations is proportional to an identity matrix, and this structure can be tested by the CRST statistic for the sphericity hypothesis test. The observations are decomposed into signal and noise subspace components by unitary coordinate transformation under a presumptive number of sources. Only when there is no signal in the presumptive noise subspace components, the corresponding CRST statistic is asymptotic normal distribution. The CRST statistic of the presumptive noise subspace components also is a statistic of the sample eigenvalues, and can be used as the statistic in the GBIC for estimating the number of sources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate detection of the number of sources in the case of a large number of sensors with relatively few samples, especially when the number of samples is smaller than the number of sensors.},

We consider different spatial/spectral sampling strategies and pare their performance for similar overall numbers of detected photons. For a regular spatial grid, the first strategy consists of sampling all the spatial locations of the grid for each of the wavelengths. Conversely, the three other strategies consist, for each spatial location, of acquiring a reduced number of wavelengths, chosen randomly or in a deterministic manner. We propose a fully automated computational method, adapted for the different sampling strategies in order to recover the target range profile, as well as the reflectivity profiles associated with the different wavelengths. The performance of the four sampling strategies is illustrated using a single photon MSL system with four wavelengths. The results presented demonstrate that although the first strategy usually provides more accurate results, the subsampling strategies do not exhibit a significant performance degradation, particularly for extremely photon-starved data (down to one photon per pixel on average).},

Building on an amplitude-based nonconvex least-squares formulation, STAF proceeds in two stages: s1) Orthogonality-promoting initialization computed using a stochastic variance reduced gradient algorithm; and, s2) Refinements of the initial point through truncated stochastic gradient-type iterations. Both stages handle a single equation per iteration, therefore lending STAF well to Big Data applications. Specifically for independent Gaussian {ai}mi=1 vectors, STAF recovers exactly any x exponentially fast when there are about as many equations as unknowns. Finally, numerical tests demonstrate that STAF improves upon its competing alternatives.},

  abstract = {In real-world image processing applications, the data is high dimensional but the amount of high-quality data needed to train the model is very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate applicability of a recently presented method for dictionary learning from incomplete data, the so-called Iterative Thresholding and K residual Means for Masked data, to deal with high-dimensional data in an efficient way. In particular, the proposed algorithm incorporates a corruption model directly at the dictionary learning stage, also enabling reconstruction of the low-rank component again from corrupted signals. These modifications circumvent some difficulties associated with the efficient dictionary learning procedure in the presence of limited or incomplete data. We choose an image inpainting problem as a guiding example, and further propose a procedure for automatic detection and reconstruction of the low-rank component from incomplete data and adaptive parameter selection for the sparse image reconstruction. We benchmark the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithm in terms of computing time and accuracy on colour, 3D medical, and hyperspectral images by comparing it to its dictionary learning counterparts.},

  abstract = {Estimation of the number of endmembers existing in a scene constitutes a critical task in the hyperspectral unmixing process. The accuracy of this estimate plays a crucial role in subsequent unsupervised unmixing steps i.e., the derivation of the spectral signatures of the endmembers (endmembers' extraction) and the estimation of the abundance fractions of the pixels. A common practice amply followed in literature is to treat endmembers' number estimation and unmixing, independently as two separate tasks, providing the outcome of the former as input to the latter. In this paper, we go beyond this computationally demanding strategy. More precisely, we set forth a multiple constrained optimization framework, which encapsulates endmembers' number estimation and unsuper-vised unmixing in a single task. This is attained by suitably formulating the problem via a low-rank and sparse nonnegative matrix factorization rationale, where low-rankness is promoted with the use of a sophisticated ℓ1/ℓ2 norm penalty term. An alternating proximal algorithm is then proposed for minimizing the emerging cost function. The results obtained by simulated and real data experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Image reconstruction algorithms for radio interferometry are challenged to scale well with TeraByte image sizes never seen before. In this work, we investigate one such 3D image reconstruction algorithm known as MUFFIN (MUlti-Frequency image reconstruction For radio INterferometry). In particular, we focus on the challenging task of automatically finding the optimal regularization parameter values. In practice, finding the regularization parameters using classical grid search is computationally intensive and nontrivial due to the lack of ground-truth. We adopt a greedy strategy where, at each iteration, the optimal parameters are found by minimizing the predicted Stein unbiased risk estimate (PSURE). The proposed self-tuned version of MUFFIN involves parallel and computationally efficient steps, and scales well with large-scale data. Finally, numerical results on a 3D image are presented to showcase the performance of the proposed approach.},

To estimate the size and 3D location of microscopic objects in holograms, maximum likelihood methods have been shown to outperform traditional approaches based on 3D image reconstruction followed by 3D image analysis. However, the presence of objects other than the object of interest may bias maximum likelihood estimates. Using experimental videos of holograms, we show that replacing the maximum likelihood with a robust estimation procedure reduces this bias. We propose a criterion based on the intersection of confidence intervals in order to automatically set the level that distinguishes between inliers and outliers. We show that this criterion achieves a bias / variance trade-off. We also show that joint analysis of a sequence of holograms using the robust procedure is shown to further improve estimation accuracy.},

The probability models are learned from the data by empirical distributions that provide an accurate approximation of the true model. Hence, the approach is fully nonparametric. The bootstrap method is employed to approximate the distribution of the decision statistic. The actual test is based on the Anderson-Darling test that is shown to perform reliably even if the empirical distributions differ only slightly. The proposed detector allows controlling Type I and II error levels without specifying explicit probability models or performing tedious large sample analysis. It is also proved that the test can achieve the specified power. Numerical simulations validate the results.},

In this communication, derivations of the existing results on the accuracy of ML estimation of misspecified models are outlined in an easily comprehensible manner.

  abstract = {When identifying a nonstationary autoregressive process, e.g. for the purpose of signal prediction or parametric spectrum estimation, two important decisions must be taken. First, one should choose the appropriate order of the autoregressive model, i.e., the number of autoregressive coefficients that will be estimated. Second, if identification is carried out using the local estimation technique, such as the localized version of the method of least squares, one should select the most appropriate estimation bandwidth, i.e., the effective width of the local data window used for the purpose of parameter tracking. The paper presents the first unified treatment of the problem of joint order and bandwidth selection. Two solutions to this problem are examined, first based on the predictive least squares principle, and second exploiting the suitably modified Akaike's final prediction error statistic. It is shown that the best results are obtained if the two approaches mentioned above are combined.},

  abstract = {The scalable extension (SHVC) of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) allows encoding in layers a video with multiple quality level such as resolution, bit-depth or Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Compared to the equivalent HEVC simulcast, the SHVC extension provides inter-layer prediction mechanisms enabling significant bit-rate savings. Moreover these inter-layer prediction mechanisms are less complex than those from former standards. Therefore, SHVC seems a promising solution for both broadcast and storage applications and is considered in the ATSC 3.0 as video coding solution. Indeed the spatial scalability is an application use-case considered in the ATSC 3.0. This paper proposes a scalable multi-layer architecture combining pipelined software HEVC encoders. The proposed architecture provides a good trade-off between parallelism over layer and latency. Moreover two configurations are proposed for Live or File encodings with real-time or best coding efficiency targets, respectively. Results present a 2× spatial scalability application of this architecture achieving in a low-delay configuration real-time video encodings of 1080p60 and 1600p30 sequences. Moreover the proposed SHVC solution also demonstrated real-time encodings of UHD contents at an ATSC 3.0 meeting in random-access configuration.},

In intra prediction, the top and left adjacent lines to the current coding block in the neighboring reconstructed blocks are selected as the reference lines. However, it has been observed that the adjacent reference line might not always provide optimal prediction due to the quantization noise and object occlusions caused by straight lines. In this paper, we propose the synthesis of another reference line by integrating multiple lines in the neighboring reconstructed blocks based on the prediction mode. The synthesized line and the reconstructed adjacent line compete in the rate distortion optimization process, where the line that yields a minimum cost is finally selected. The proposed method is implemented on top of JEM 3.0, and the experimental results show that -0.29% (average), -1.15% (maximum) luma BD gain and -0.15% (average), -0.59% (maximum) luma BD gain can be achieved in all intra and random access conditions, respectively, among all the test sequences.},

  abstract = {With the recent introduction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Wide Color Gamut (WCG) technologies, viewers' quality of experience is highly enriched. To distribute HDR videos over a transmission pipeline, color pixels need to be quantized into integer code-words. Linear quantization is not optimal since the Human Visual System (HVS) do not perceive light in a linear fashion. Thus, perceptual transfer functions (PTFs) and color pixel representations are used to convert linear light and color values into a non-linear domain, so that they correspond more closely to the response of the human eye. In this work, we measure the visual color differences caused by different PTFs and color representation with 10-bit quantization. Our study encompasses all the visible colors of the BT.2020 gamut at different representative luminance levels. Visual color differences are predicted using a perceptual color error metric (CIE ΔE2000). Results show that visible color distortion can already occur before any type of video compression is performed on the signal and that choosing the right PTF and color representation can greatly reduce these distortions and effectively enhance the quality of experience.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a method for reducing coding artifacts introduced by lossy image compression is proposed. The method is similar to sample adaptive offset (SAO) which is adopted in the H.265/HEVC video coding standard as one of in-loop filtering tools. In the SAO, samples of the reconstructed image are classified into several categories based on some simple algorithms, and an optimum offset value is then added to the samples belonging to each category. Since the classification algorithms are switched on a block-by-block basis, not a negligible amount of side-information must be transmitted to the decoder in addition to the offset values. On the other hand, our method adopts a machine learning technique using a support vector machine (SVM) for the classification process. By applying the common SVM classifier to a whole image, the amount of the side-information can be considerably reduced. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides bitrate savings of up to 1.0 % for HD size images degraded through intra frame coding of the H.265/HEVC standard.},

  pages = {1495-1499},
  abstract = {Most current state of the art blind image deconvolution methods model the underlying image (either in the image or filter space) using sparsity promoting priors and perform inference, that is, image, blur, and parameter estimation using variational approximation. In this paper we propose the use of the spike-and-slab prior model in the filter space and a variational posterior approximation more expressive than mean field. The spike-and-slab prior model, which is the {"}gold-standard{"} in sparse machine learning, has the ability to selectively shrink irrelevant variables while relevant variables are mildly regularized. This allows to discard irrelevant information while preserving important features for the estimation of the blur which results in more precise and less noisy blur kernel estimates. In this paper we present a variational inference algorithm for estimating the blur in the filter space, which is both more efficient than MCMC and more accurate than the standard mean field variational approximation. The parameters of the prior model are automatically estimated together with the blur. Once the blur is estimated, a non-blind image restoration algorithm is used to obtain the sharp image. We prove the efficacy of our method on both synthetically generated and real images.},

  abstract = {A free viewpoint application has been developed that yields an immersive user experience. The free viewpoint approach called the {"}billboard methodis{"} suitable for displaying a synthesized 3D view in a mobile device, but it suffers from the limitation that a billboard cannot present an accurate impression of depth for a foreground object, and it gives users an unacceptable impression from certain virtual viewpoints. To solve this problem, we propose the optimal deformation of the billboard. The deformation is designed as a mapping of grid points in the input billboard silhouette to produce an optimal silhouette from an accurate voxel model of the object. We formulate and solve this procedure as a nonlinear optimization problem based on a grid-point constraint and some a priori information. Our results show that the optimal deformation is produced by the proposed method, which generates a synthesized virtual image having a natural appearance.},

For this reason, HEVC offers three coarse grained parallelization potentials namely, wave front, slices and tiles. In this paper we focus on tile parallelism which is a relatively new concept with its effects not yet fully explored. Particularly, we investigate the problem of partitioning a frame into tiles so that in a resulting one on one tile-CPU core assignment the cores are load balanced, thus, maximum speedup can be achieved. We propose various heuristics for the problem with a focus on low delay coding and evaluate them against state of the art approaches. Results demonstrate that particular heuristic combinations clearly outperform their counterparts in the literature.},

In this paper we present a detailed energy consumption analysis, considering the consumption components of CPU, cache memories and main memory, for all ×265 presets executing in a multicore system. Ten HD 1080p test video sequences with different motion and brightness characteristics are used in the experiments. Three tools are used to obtain the results: CACTI, PCM and Perf. To get more reliable time/energy results, 10 executions were performed for each preset. The results show that fast presets are 47× faster than slower presets. However, slower presets use robust configurations and achieve large reductions in bitrate. Due to this, the ultrafast preset has a bitrate 45% higher than placebo preset. Furthermore, the system energy consumption increases 45×, from ultrafast preset to placebo preset. Our experiments clearly present the dependence between bitrate and energy consumption for all encoding presets, which allows us to choose the best bitrate/energy trade-off for each platform at hand.},

Otherwise, the scheme applies an Iterative-Small Diamond Search Pattern (I-SDSP), which is a lightweight center-biased algorithm for efficient encoding of homogeneous blocks.

  abstract = {This paper deals with a mixed norm of complex vectors, i.e., the sum of amplitude spectra, and its minimization problem. A combination of this mixed norm and image decomposition problem works well for reduction and decomposition of pattern noise that arises when scanning old photographs with granulated surface. Generally, the spectral distribution of natural images decreases smoothly from low frequency band toward high frequency band, while that of pattern noise is distributed sparsely. Therefore, we assume that an observed image consists of a latent image component and a pattern noise component, and characterize them by using the total variation function and the proposed function, respectively. This enables a reasonable decomposition of the two components. Compared to similar decomposition methods such as Robust PCA, our method has a good decomposition accuracy for this task, and low computational cost.},

First a Tone Mapping Operator (TMO) generates the Low Dynamic Range (LDR) version of the HDR content together with its extra information. The obtained LDR image is encoded using an optimized JPEG coding scheme, whereas the extra information is encoded as side data. Specifically, the optimized JPEG based algorithm constructs near-optimal rate-distortion quantization tables using DCT coefficient distribution statistics and Lagrangian optimization approach. To ensure accurate HDR reconstruction, the extra information is compressed with conventional JPEG encoder using the highest quality level. The aim of the proposed HDR coding system is twofold. First, it performs a bit allocation mechanism, to achieve near-optimal rate control. Second, it maintains the backward compatibility with the conventional JPEG. Experiments show that the compression performance of the proposed HDR coder outperforms that of the reference method.},

It present an iterative denoising algorithm based on the 2-D windowed Fourier Transform. The algorithm is a new approach based on the SOS procedure recently proposed by Y. Romano and M. Elad adapted to phase processing. The approach is proposed in the case of the 2-D windowed Fourier Transform algorithm applied to phase maps which constitutes the state of the art in the field of digital holography. The reason is that the sum and difference operations used in the SOS procedure cannot be computed directly on phase maps but using a sine and cosine representation in order to avoid 2n phase jumps. Results on simulated phase maps including realistic noise conditions encountered in digital holography show the advantage of the proposed iterative approach. The paper proposes the application of the method to denoising of phase images from digital three color holography applied to cracks characterization of a composite materiel under mechanical strength test.},

Moreover, the variance of a feature with a few samples is pointless unless it represents the data distribution efficiently. Instead of looking at the samples in groups, we evaluate their efficiency based on pair-wise fashion. In our investigation, we noticed that considering a pair of samples at a time and selecting the features that bring them closer or put them far away is a better choice for feature selection. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with low sample size, which outperforms many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

  abstract = {Modeling the activity of an ensemble of neurons can provide critical insights into the workings of the brain. In this work we examine if learning based signal modeling can contribute to a high quality modeling of neuronal signal data. To that end, we employ the sparse coding and dictionary learning schemes for capturing the behavior of neuronal responses into a small number of representative prototypical signals. Performance is measured by the reconstruction quality of clean and noisy test signals, which serves as an indicator of the generalization and discrimination capabilities of the learned dictionaries. To validate the merits of the proposed approach, a novel dataset of the actual recordings from 183 neurons from the primary visual cortex of a mouse in early postnatal development was developed and investigated. The results demonstrate that high quality modeling of testing data can be achieved from a small number of training examples and that the learned dictionaries exhibit significant specificity when introducing noise.},

  abstract = {Particle filters are powerful methods for state estimation in nonlinear/non-Gaussian dynamical systems. However due to the heavy computational requirements, they may not satisfy the real-time constraints in many applications requiring a large number of particles. By means of distributed implementation, real-time particle filtering can be achieved. However, the resampling stage in particle filters requires particle interaction which causes communication overhead. In this work, we propose a distributed resampling algorithm based on Butterfly Resampling previously described in the literature. We describe three interaction schemes (i) the complete interaction, (ii) the pairwise interaction where the nodes are constrained to communicate in pairs and (iii) the partial pairwise interaction in which only one pair is allowed to communicate. The goal is to diminish the communication cost in exchange for negligible loss of effective sample size. We conduct experiments on a cluster environment and compare our methods in terms of execution time, communication time and effective sample size. We find that the sparse interaction schemes show better performance for distributed systems and they keep the effective sample size nearly as high as the complete interaction scheme does.},

The basis used in the present study involves multiple Gaussian kernels. The sequence generated by the algorithm is expected to approach towards the best approximation, in the L2-norm sense, of the nonlinear function to be estimated. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional kernel adaptive filtering paradigm because the best approximation in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generally differs from the minimum mean squared error estimator over the subspace (Yukawa and Müller 2016).

The class of the convex function hence includes the morphological dilation and can be trained for specific image processing tasks. In this paper, the closing filter is extended to a convex-concave filter with maxout. The convex-concave filter is trained for noise and mask removal with a training set.

The proposed solution uses recursive Markov state disaggregation to construct an ergodic map with a piecewise constant invariant density function that approximates an arbitrary probability distribution over a compact interval. The solution is novel in the sense that it provides greater freedom, as compared to existing analytic solutions, in specifying the autocorrelation function of the semi-Markov map during its construction. The proposed solution is demonstrated by constructing multiple chaotic maps with invariant densities that provide an increasingly accurate approximation of the asymmetric beta probability distribution over the unit interval. It is demonstrated that normalised autocorrelation functions with components having different rates of decay and which alternate in sign between consecutive delays may be specified. It is concluded that the flexibility of the proposed solution facilitates its application towards modelling of random signals in various contexts.},

  abstract = {The spectral envelope of a speech signal encodes information about the characteristics of the speech source. As a result, spectral envelope modeling is a central task in speech applications, where tracking temporal transitions in diphones and triphones is essential for efficient speech synthesis and recognition algorithms. Temporal changes in the envelope structure are often derived from estimated formant tracks, an approach which is sensitive to estimation errors. In this paper we propose a speech source model which estimates frequency and amplitude movements in the spectral envelopes of speech signals and does not rely on formant tracking. The proposed model estimates the amplitude and frequency shifts for each sub-band and time frame of a speech signal using the information from the previous time frame. Our experiments demonstrate that the model captures temporal structures of spectral envelopes with high precision. The proposed model can thus be applied as an accurate low-order representation of temporal dynamics in speech spectral envelopes.},

We do not attempt any post processing to study the effectiveness of F0 on epoch estimation in the proposed method.

Conventional speech synthesis systems has separate modeling for pitch (FO-model) and spectral representation, namely Mel generalized coefficients (MGC) (MGC-model). In this paper we estimate pitch from the MGC estimated using MGC-model instead of having a separate FO-model. Pitch is obtained from the estimated MGC using a statistical mapping through Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Experiments using CMU-ARCTIC database demonstrate that the proposed GMM based FO-model, even with a single mixture, results in no significant loss in the naturalness of the synthesized speech while the proposed FO-model, in addition to reducing computational complexity, results in ~93% reduction in the number of parameters compared to that of the F0-model.},

  abstract = {Many of today's signal processing tasks consider sparse models where the number of explanatory variables exceeds the sample size. When dealing with real-world data, the presence of impulsive noise and outliers must also be accounted for. Accurate and robust parameter estimation and consistent variable selection are needed simultaneously. Recently, some popular robust methods have been adapted to such complex settings. Especially, in high dimensional settings, however, it is possible to have a single contaminated predictor being responsible for many outliers. The amount of outliers introduced by this predictor easily exceeds the breakdown point of any existing robust estimator. Therefore, we propose a new robust and sparse estimator, the Outlier-Corrected-Data-(Adaptive) Lasso (OCD-(A) Lasso). It simultaneously handles highly contaminated predictors in the dataset and performs well under the classical contamination model. In a numerical study, it outperforms competing Lasso estimators, at a largely reduced computational complexity compared to its robust counterparts.},

In this paper, we propose to study the JD between processes that are defined as sums of complex-valued sinusoidal processes disturbed by additive white noises. We show that the JD tends to a stationary behavior when the number of variates becomes large. The derivative of the JD becomes a constant that depends on the parameters defining the processes. The convergence speed towards this stationary regime depends on the differences between the normalized angular frequencies. The smaller the difference, the slower the convergence. This result can be obtained by interpreting some steps to compute the JD as orthogonal projections. Some examples illustrate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {In linear/nonlinear dynamical systems, there are many situations where model parameters cannot be obtained a priori or vary with time. As a consequence, the estimation algorithms that are based on the exact knowledge of these model parameters cannot be accurate in this context. In this work, a kernel density-based particle filter is investigated to jointly estimate the states and unknown time-varying parameters of a dynamical system described by nonlinear state and measurement equations. The approach combines an auxiliary particle filter with the kernel smoothing method so as to obtain a stationary kernel density for the unknown parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated for positioning using measurements from a global navigation satellite system that are possibly contaminated by multipath interferences.},

These new interpretations pave the way to new methods for enhanced rating prediction. For collaborative filtering, we develop more general band stop graph filters.

It is shown that the number of RF-chains can be reduced even below the number of eigenmodes of the channel, thereby closing the gap between the standard hybrid A-D and the single-RF MIMO. This is achieved by dividing the input data streams into blocks and jointly optimizing the digital and the analog precoder parts for each block. The analog part of the precoder needs to be updated once per block and remains static over each block interval. Out of band radiation due to switching is resolved by inserting a short guard interval between blocks. It is shown the number of RF-chains can be any arbitrary positive integer to obtain zero distortion at the user terminals if the update rate is high enough. The proposed precoder offers a significant performance gain at the expenses of data dependent precoding and higher update rates of the analog part.},

  abstract = {Electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) technology provides multi-antenna transmission with a single radio frequency (RF) unit. In order to achieve stable transmission using an ESPAR antenna (EA), two approaches have been proposed in literature. One is to increase the self-resistance of an EA, the other is to transmit signals closely approximating the actual signals that keep the EA stable. In both approaches, no constraint on the transmission power of an EA was considered. This is not the case in actual systems, as the practical power amplifier normally has limited peak power. Taking into account the limited power availability, an optimization problem is formulated with the objective to minimize the MSE between the currents corresponding to the ideal and the approximate transmission signals. The non-convex problem is solved analytically by coordination transformation and a novel algorithm is proposed. It is shown that the system employing the proposed transmission scheme gives similar performance to that of a standard multiple antenna system, especially at low SNRs. In addition, it is shown that increasing the self-resistance of an EA to achieve stability is highly power inefficient.},

To estimate how accurate the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches are, the Bird Audio Detection challenge involving large audio datasets was recently organized. In this paper, experiments using several types of convolutional neural networks (i.e. standard CNNs, residual nets and densely connected nets) are reported in the framework of this challenge. DenseNets were the preferred solution since they were the best performing and most compact models, leading to a 88.22% area under the receiver operator curve score on the test set of the challenge (ranked 3rd/30)1. Performance gains were obtained thank to data augmentation through time and frequency shifting, model parameter averaging during training and ensemble methods using the geometric mean. On the contrary, the attempts to enlarge the training dataset with samples of the test set with automatic predictions used as pseudo-groundtruth labels consistently degraded performance.},

  abstract = {Bird audio detection (BAD) aims to detect whether there is a bird call in an audio recording or not. One difficulty of this task is that the bird sound datasets are weakly labelled, that is only the presence or absence of a bird in a recording is known, without knowing when the birds call. We propose to apply joint detection and classification (JDC) model on the weakly labelled data (WLD) to detect and classify an audio clip at the same time. First, we apply VGG like convolutional neural network (CNN) on mel spectrogram as baseline. Then we propose a JDC-CNN model with VGG as a classifier and CNN as a detector. We report the denoising method including optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OM-LSA), median filter and spectral spectrogram will worse the classification accuracy on the contrary to previous work. JDC-CNN can predict the time stamps of the events from weakly labelled data, so is able to do sound event detection from WLD. We obtained area under curve (AUC) of 95.70% on the development data and 81.36% on the unseen evaluation data, which is nearly comparable to the baseline CNN model.},

  abstract = {Bird activity detection is the task of determining if a bird sound is present in a given audio recording. This paper describes a bird activity detector which utilises a support vector machine (SVM) with a dynamic kernel. Dynamic kernels are used to process sets of feature vectors having different cardinalities. Probabilistic sequence kernel (PSK) is one such dynamic kernel. The PSK converts a set of feature vectors from a recording into a fixed-length vector. We propose to use a variant of PSK in this work. Before computing the fixed-length vector, cepstral mean and variance normalisation and short-time Gaussianization is performed on the feature vectors. This reduces environment mismatch between different recordings. Additionally, we also demonstrate a simple procedure to speed up the proposed method by reducing the size of fixed-length vector. A speedup of almost 70% is observed, with a very small drop in accuracy. The proposed method is also compared with a random forest classifier and is shown to outperform it.},

A system which uses morphology, acoustic and plumage evidence to review species status of bird populations was presented by Tobias et al. The acoustic evidence in that work was extracted using manual inspection of spectrograms. The current work seeks to automate this process. Signal processing techniques are employed in this paper to automate the extraction of the acoustic features: maximum, minimum and peak frequency, and bandwidth. YIN-bird, a pitch detection algorithm optimized for birds, and sine-track method, successfully applied to bird species recognition previously, are the automatic methods employed. The performance of automatic methods is compared to the manual method currently used by zoologists. Both methods are well suited to this task, and demonstrate the strong potential to begin to automate the task of acoustic comparison of bird species.},

  abstract = {Acoustic monitoring of bird species is an increasingly important field in signal processing. Many available bird sound datasets do not contain exact timestamp of the bird call but have a coarse weak label instead. Traditional Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models are not well designed to deal with weakly labeled data. In this paper we propose a novel Masked Non-negative Matrix Factorization (Masked NMF) approach for bird detection using weakly labeled data. During dictionary extraction we introduce a binary mask on the activation matrix. In that way we are able to control which parts of dictionary are used to reconstruct the training data. We compare our method with conventional NMF approaches and current state of the art methods. The proposed method outperforms the NMF baseline and offers a parsimonious model for bird detection on weakly labeled data. Moreover, to our knowledge, the proposed Masked NMF achieved the best result among non-deep learning methods on a test dataset used for the recent Bird Audio Detection Challenge.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method based on the archetypal analysis (AA) for bird activity detection (BAD) task. The proposed method extracts a convex representation (frame-wise) by projecting a given audio signal on to a learned dictionary. The AA based dictionary is trained only on bird class signals, which makes the method robust to background noise. Further, it is shown that due to the inherent sparsity property of convex representations, non-bird class signals will have a denser representation as compared to the bird counterpart, which helps in effective discrimination. In order to detect presence/absence of bird vocalization, a fixed length representation is obtained by averaging the obtained frame wise representations of an audio signal. Classification of these fixed length representations is performed using support vector machines (SVM) with a dynamic kernel. In this work, we propose a variant of probabilistic sequence kernel called sparse convex sequence kernel (SCSK) for the BAD task. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently discriminate bird from non-bird class signals.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automatic system for detection of bird species in field recordings. A sinusoidal detection algorithm is employed to segment the acoustic scene into isolated spectro-temporal segments. Each segment is represented as a temporal sequence of frequencies of the detected sinusoid, referred to as frequency track. Each bird species is represented by a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs), each HMM modelling an individual type of bird vocalisation element. These HMMs are obtained in an unsupervised manner. The detection is based on a likelihood ratio of the test utterance against the target bird species and non-target background model. We explore on selection of cohort for modelling the background model, z-norm and t-norm score normalisation techniques and score compensation to deal with outlier data. Experiments are performed using over 40 hours of audio field recordings from 48 bird species plus an additional 16 hours of field recordings as impostor trials. Evaluations are performed using detection error trade-off plots. The equal error rate of 5% is achieved when impostor trials are non-target bird species vocalisations and 1.2% when using field recordings which do not contain bird vocalisations.},

We present a speech analysis method based on pole-zero modeling of speech with mixed block sparse and Gaussian excitation.

Moreover, motivated by the block sparse glottal flow excitation during voiced speech and the white noise excitation for unvoiced speech, we model the excitation sequence as a combination of block sparse signals and white noise. A variational EM (VEM) method is proposed for estimating the posterior PDFs of the block sparse residuals and point estimates of modelling parameters within a sparse Bayesian learning framework. Compared to conventional pole-zero and all-pole based methods, experimental results show that the proposed method has lower spectral distortion and good performance in reconstructing of the block sparse excitation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose to use modified Gammatone filterbank with Teager Energy Operator (TEO) for environmental sound classification (ESC) task. TEO can track energy as a function of both amplitude and frequency of an audio signal. TEO is better for capturing energy variations in the signal that is produced by a real physical system, such as, environmental sounds that contain amplitude and frequency modulations. In proposed feature set, we have used Gammatone filterbank since it represents characteristics of human auditory processing. Here, we have used two classifiers, namely, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using cepstral features, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using spectral features. We performed experiments on two datasets, namely, ESC-50, and UrbanSound8K. We compared TEO-based coefficients with Mel filter cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCC), in which GTCC used mean square energy. Using GMM, the proposed TEO-based Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (TEO-GTCC), and its score-level fusion with MFCC gave absolute improvement of 0.45 %, and 3.85 % in classification accuracy over MFCC on ESC-50 dataset. Similarly, on UrbanSound8K dataset the proposed TEO-GTCC, and its score-level fusion with GTCC gave absolute improvement of 1.40 %, and 2.44 % in classification accuracy over MFCC. Using CNN, the score-level fusion of Gammatone spectral coefficient (GTSC) and the proposed TEO-based Gammatone spectral coefficients (TEO-GTSC) gave absolute improvement of 14.10 %, and 14.52 % in classification accuracy over Mel filterbank energies (FBE) on ESC-50 and UrbanSond8K datasets, respectively. This shows that proposed TEO-based Gammatone features contain complementary information which is helpful in ESC task.},

Considering a small number of synchronized UGRs, we formulate in this paper simple linear audio mixing approaches to combine the available audio content. We use data from two different public events to perform a comparative listening test with the goal to assess the potential of such mixtures in improving the listening experience of the captured event, as opposed to when each UGR is consumed individually. The results of the listening tests indicate that, even with just a small number of overlapping UGRs, the outcome of the mixing process gains higher preference in comparison to original UGRs played back individually.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {1824-1828},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel kernel learning scheme for acoustic scene classification using multiple short-term observations. The method takes inspiration from the recent result of psychological research - {"}Humans use summary statistics to perceive auditory sequences{"} we endeavor to devise computational framework imitating such important auditory mechanism for acoustic scene parsing. Conventional schemes usually encode spectro-temporal patterns with a compact feature vector by time-averaging, e.g. in Gaussian Mixture models (GMM). However, such integration may not be the ideal, since the arithmetic mean is vulnerable to extreme outliers which can be generated by sounds irrelevant to scene category. In this work, an effective scheme has been developed to exploit rich discriminant information from multiple short-term observations of an acoustic scene. Concretely, we first segment audio recording into short slices, e.g. 2 seconds; one vector can be extracted from each slice consisting of descriptive features. Then, we employ the resultant feature matrix to represent an acoustic scene. Since discriminant information of an acoustic scene can be characterized by either global structure or local patterns, we perform heterogeneous kernel analysis in hybrid feature spaces. Moreover, we conditionally fuse the two-way discriminant information to achieve better classification. The proposed method is validated using DCASE2016 challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.},

The approach suppresses the strong out-of-band frequencies of the carrier signal without introducing distortion of the in-band coded signal. Such method can achieve superior reduction compared to the out-of-band artefact suppression induced by traditional analog low-pass filters employed in typical Class-D audio amplifiers or other switching power delivery systems, hence allowing designs with reduced filter requirements or even filterless implementations.},

  abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) listeners were found to have great difficulty with vocal emotion recognition because of the limited spectral cues provided by CI devices. Previous studies have shown that the modulation spectral features of temporal envelopes may be important cues for vocal emotion recognition of noise-vocoded speech (NVS) as simulated CIs. In this paper, the feasibility of vocal emotion conversion on a modulation spectrogram for simulated CIs for correctly recognizing vocal emotion is confirmed. A method based on a linear prediction scheme is proposed to modify the modulation spectrogram and its features of neutral speech to match that of emotional speech. The logic of this approach is that if vocal emotion perception of NVS is based on the modulation spectral features, NVS with similar modulation spectral features of emotional speech will be recognized as the same emotion. As a result, it was found that the modulation spectrogram of neutral speech can be successfully converted to that of emotional speech. The results of the evaluation experiment showed the feasibility of vocal emotion conversion on the modulation spectrogram for simulated CIs. The vocal emotion enhancement on the modulation spectrogram was also further discussed.},

Automatic detection of this class of sounds can help hearing impaired or distracted people, e.g., on the road, and contribute to their independence and safety. In this paper, we present a technique for the detection of alarm sounds in noisy environments. The technique is not limited to particular alarms and can detect most electronically generated alerting sounds within 200 ms. We consider a set of acoustic features and use the ReliefF algorithm to select only the ones that best differentiate between alarms and other sounds. We use an SVM classifier as the detector. On the tested dataset, consisting of several dozen alarm sounds and several dozen background noises, the proposed technique shows an accuracy of 98% per audio frame. With a larger training dataset, this result is expected to substantially improve.},

  abstract = {Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is concerned with the problem of producing the pitch content of a piece of music given a recorded signal. Many methods rely on sparse or low rank models, where the observed magnitude spectra are represented as a linear combination of dictionary atoms corresponding to individual pitches. Some of the most successful approaches use Non-negative Matrix Decomposition (NMD) or Factorization (NMF), which can be used to learn a dictionary and pitch activation matrix from a given signal. Here we introduce a further refinement of NMD in which we assume the transcription itself is approximately low rank. The intuition behind this approach is that the total number of distinct activation patterns should be relatively small since the pitch content between adjacent frames should be similar. A rank penalty is introduced into the NMD objective function and solved using an iterative algorithm based on Singular Value thresholding. We find that the low rank assumption leads to a significant increase in performance compared to NMD using β-divergence on a standard AMT dataset.},

We investigated the effectiveness of state-of-the-art event sound classification methods, i.e., a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for drone sound detection. Our empirical results, which were obtained with a testing dataset collected on an urban street, confirmed the effectiveness of these models for operating in a real environment.

In this paper, we attempt to overcome these challenges by using an acoustic resonance testing model that combines features extraction with defect classification from acoustic natural vibration signals. In this case the study doesn't focus on typical defects like cracks but on defective components in the sense of geometric configurations which are out of tolerance range. With an optimal feature extraction algorithm and a classifier training step, the proposed approach significantly accelerates the detection speed of unacceptable deviations in dimensions and parallely enhances the accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is that an optimal feature from acoustic signals is found which represents the geometric parameters most appropriately, meanwhile, the most appropriate classifier is obtained which significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy in defect classification.},

VMD is a method to decompose an input signal into an ensemble of sub-signals (modes) which is entirely non-recursive. It determines the relevant bands adaptively, and estimates the corresponding modes concurrently. In order to optimally decompose a given signal, VMD seeks an ensemble of modes with narrow-band properties corresponding to the Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) definition used in Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). In our proposed modified VMD approach, in order to obtain the bandwidth of a mode, each mode is shifted to baseband by mixing an exponential that is adjusted to the respective center frequency. The bandwidth is estimated through elastic net method that linearly combines penalties of the Lasso and Ridge Regression methods. Simulation results on fundamental frequency estimation of real music and synthetic test data show better performance compared to classical VMD based approach, and other common methods used for music signals, such as YIN and MELODIA based methods.},

However, to analyze successfully complex cell movies, imaging multiple interacting bacterial clones as they grow and merge to generate overcrowded bacterial communities with thousands of cells in the field of view, segmentation results should be near perfect to warrant good tracking results. We introduce here a fully automated closed-loop bio-inspired computational strategy that exploits prior knowledge about the expected structure of a colony's lineage tree to locate and correct segmentation errors in analyzed movie frames. We show that this correction strategy is effective, resulting in improved cell tracking and consequently trustworthy deep colony lineage trees. Our image analysis approach has the unique capability to keep tracking cells even after clonal subpopulations merge in the movie. This enables the reconstruction of the complete Forest of Lineage Trees (FLT) representation of evolving multi-clonal bacterial communities. Moreover, the percentage of valid cell trajectories extracted from the image analysis almost doubles after segmentation correction. This plethora of trustworthy data extracted from a complex cell movie analysis enables single-cell analytics as a tool for addressing compelling questions for human health, such as understanding the role of single-cell stochasticity in antibiotics resistance without losing site of the inter-cellular interactions and microenvironment effects that may shape it.},

In this paper, we present evidence that information derived from observers' gaze can be used to infer their age. This is the first study showing that simple features extracted from the ordered sequence of fixations and saccades allow us to predict the age of an observer. Eye movements of 101 participants split into 4 age groups (adults, 6-10 year-old, 4-6 year-old and 2 year-old) were recorded while exploring static images. The analysis of observers' gaze provides evidence of age-related differences in viewing patterns. Therefore, we extract from the scanpaths several features, including fixation durations and saccade amplitudes, and learn a direct mapping from those features to age using Gentle AdaBoost classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed image-blind method succeeds in predicting the age of the observer up to 92% of the time. The use of predicted salience does not further improve the classification's accuracy.},

  abstract = {In the health self-management services it is beneficial to identify and address the already existing healthy activity patterns of the user. Some of these healthy activity patterns might be of a utilitarian nature, e.g. commuting to work by bike or on foot, or might be for leisure, like taking a walk in a park. In this paper we discuss one possibility to detect the utilitarian or leisure nature of a particular ambulatory path based on the geometry of the trajectory. In essence, a leisure trip is more commonly a round-trip while an utilitarian A-to-B trips follow the single shortest path between A and B. We define a generic measure for the characterization of utilitarian and leisure paths based on GPS location data and develop an algorithm for approaching the same based on only magnetometer data from a wearable device.},

The proposed codec builds on top of the JPEG image coding standard and its rate-distortion performance is assessed using a novel methodology, particularly suitable for perceptual image codecs as the one proposed in this paper.

  pages = {1907-1911},
  abstract = {This paper studies the lossless compressibility of raw sensor images acquired by plenoptic cameras, when optimally interpolating the microlens images in terms of already encoded microlens images. The geometrical information necessary for splitting the sensor image into projections of microlenses, together with a relatively small bitstream for encoding the raw image at the microlens centers are encoded as a first stage. The scanning order for sampling the data from the sensor follows row-by-row the approximate hexagonal lattice pattern of the microlenses, and the pixels inside each microlens are scanned in an ascending spiral order. The predictive encoding of a pixel from a microlens block uses the similarly located pixels (possibly slightly shifted) in the blocks from nine closest causal microlenses (those already encoded) and the pixels from its own microlens located in the encoded part of the spiral. A minimum description length optimal sparse predictor is designed for each microlens. The sparsity masks and prediction coefficients are encoded in a second stage and the prediction errors at every pixel are finally encoded in a third stage, in a view-by-view order (a view index being determined by the pixel's index in its block), using contexts accounting for the magnitude of errors at views already encoded. The experimental results show better performance than the JPEG 2000 image standard applied on the raw image.},

In this paper we propose a two-layer tracking method that enables automatic occlusion handling and inter-sensor identification for object detection and tracking that utilizes more than one depth sensor. On the first layer, the tracking is first performed independently for each sensor to extract objects' feature and perform initial tracking with separation of the occluded objects. On the second layer, the tracking is performed in the perspective projection of the objects tracked on the first layer that are combined in a single processing plane to provide correct identification of the objects that are detected in one sensor to another. Experiment results show that the proposed method can correctly identified occluded objects and objects that are moving between sensors coverage area.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for estimating the height of extended objects using a Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW) automotive radar. The proposed algorithm exploits the frequency shift caused by the Doppler effect while approaching stationary objects, to estimate target heights. Thus, the algorithm does not require multiple vertical antennas for height finding. First, the measured radial velocity is derived using sensor target geometry, then, a target height is formulated as a function of target range, vehicle velocity and elevation angle component of the measured radial velocity. Next, the processing pipeline of the proposed Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS) algorithm is described, and the three dimensional (3D) high resolution RELAX is applied to collected radar data to provide accurate range, azimuth angle and Doppler estimations of the detected targets. Finally height measurement results of an entrance gate 4.5 m high are presented and discussed. The results show that the proposed height finding algorithm can achieve a root mean squared error of 0.26 m.},

  abstract = {Automotive radars operate in challenging environments that include objects with similar position and speed as well as objects with diverse positions and velocities. Automated driving requires the radar to discriminate close objects and also to accurately estimate the position of the objects in the field-of-view. Doppler filtering is essential to fulfill this goal. In conventional automotive radars the Doppler processing has a fixed and predetermined filtering integration time and hence a fixed Doppler resolution. However, in this case, setting the Doppler resolution is a tradeoff between high resolution that enables discrimination of close objects and accurate estimation of their position. In this paper we develop a multi-resolution Doppler processing method that resolves this tradeoff. The performance advantages of multi-resolution Doppler processing compared to the conventional fixed Doppler resolution are evaluated in an automotive scenario. It is shown that the multi-resolution Doppler processing attains better discrimination of close objects as well as more accurate position estimation of the objects.},

  abstract = {The common researches for radar system modelling are mostly based on deductive methods, which forward simulate the radar working process according to the information of radar parameters and expert system. However, the radar prior information obtained is limited under battlefield background. So it is difficult to model the radar operating modes and schedule schemes accurately, especially for the multi-function radars (MFRs) which are able to employ multiple modes flexibly. A novel method of reverse modelling for MFR is proposed. The information of the waveform is translated into grammar according to the theory of formal language, and the corresponding Finite-state Automaton (FSA) is composed as initialization. Then, according to the thought of data-driven, the transition relations and probabilities between MFR modes are yielded by analysing the intercepted signals. Finally, the stochastic finite automaton (SFA) is composed, achieving the MFR model by reverse modelling. Simulation with hypothetical MFR signal data is presented, showing that the proposed method is able to compose its SFA effectively, which can be used in MFR state recognition to support the adaptive radar countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Sparse sensor arrays can match the performance of fully populated arrays using substantially fewer elements. However, finding the array configuration with the smallest number of elements is generally a computationally difficult problem. Consequently, simple to generate array configurations that may be suboptimal are of high practical interest. This paper presents a novel closed-form sparse linear array configuration designed for active sensing, called the Concatenated Nested Array (CNA). The key parameters of the CNA are derived. The CNA is also compared to the optimal Minimum-Redundancy Array (MRA) in numerical simulations. The CNA is shown to require only about 10% more elements than the MRA in the limit of large apertures.},

In particular, we propose a submodular set-function that can be maximized using a linear-time greedy heuristic that is near optimal. Different from the convex formulation that is typically used to solve the sensor selection problem, the method in this paper neither involves computationally intensive semidefinite programs nor convex relaxation of the Boolean variables. While numerical experiments show a comparable performance between the convex and submodular relaxations, in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio, the latter finds a near-optimal solution with a significantly reduced computational complexity.},

  abstract = {Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using non-uniform linear arrays is considered. We focus on the so called {"}fully augmentable arrays{"} (FAAs) with full set of covariance lags. In FAAs, the number of covariance lags is usually larger than the number of sensors in the array. Thus, with FAAs more sources than the number of sensors can be identified. Existing DOA estimation algorithms for FAAs are based on the assumption of uncorrelated sources. In this paper, based on compressed sensing, we present a DOA estimation algorithm for FAAs without assuming uncorrelated sources. The proposed algorithm is based on the newly introduced gridless SPARse ROW-norm reconstruction (SPARROW) formulation for the joint sparse reconstruction from multiple measurement vectors. By numerical experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the presence of correlated signals or small number of snapshots. Moreover, using simulations, the behavior of the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the case of correlated source is demonstrated and it is shown that, when the number of sources is larger than the number of sensors, the CRB for FAAs approaches zero at infinitely large signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) only if the sources are fully correlated.},

The effects of multipath fading channel are applied to the signal at the level of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing1 (OFDM) transmitter prior to IFFT stage. Models 0 and 1 are based on Digital Fourier Transform (DFT) of TDL with and without consideration of Intercarrier Interference (ICI) phenomenon. Model 2 is the novel method that extends quasi-stationary model with low-cost linear approximation of ICI applied directly in frequency domain in order to gain overall accuracy with small computational effort. When limiting the ICI term to 16 neighboring subcarriers, Model 2 exhibits 12 dB SNR improvement comparing to stationary model and offers execution time advantage comparing to TDL model when the number of terminals sharing radio resources is high.},

However, the complexity depends on the number of states, which increases very fast as the protocol gets more sophisticated. We then derive a simplified model using state aggregation, and obtain a compact description which can be used to predict the performance with a reduced complexity. Moreover, we show that the simplified model describes a probabilistic communication protocol on the same network.

To address these issues, we need to design energy efficient communication systems with higher data rates while considering practical limitations. As a solution, we design an optimal M-PSK directional modulation precoder with spatial peak power minimization where the communicated symbol on each receiving antenna is placed in the optimal location of a predefined region. Such an approach allows less stringent design and results in further energy efficiency. In this work, we characterize the relaxed region, formulate the optimal symbollevel precoder design problem, and transform it into a standard form. The simulation results show that the relaxed design reduces the consumed power while the symbol error rate increment at the receiver due to the relaxed phase design is negligible.},

  pages = {2026-2030},
  abstract = {Cracks are among the most commonly found road surface degradations, requiring periodical road surveys for monitoring pavement quality. Images of road pavement surface can be automatically processed, typically employing segmentation algorithms to identify cracks. However, a set of distinct connected components often result, leading to the detection of several independent crack segments, although they may belong to the same pavement surface defect. This is often observed for cracks that exhibit a longer linear development or present several branches. This paper presents a new strategy to identify cracks on images captured during road pavement surveys, even when those cracks appear with a complex shape. The proposed crack segmentation algorithm includes two stages: (i) selection of prominent {"}crack seeds{"}, adopting an efficient segmentation procedure, after appropriate image smoothing, minimizing the detection of false positives; (ii) iterative binary pixel classification, into the crack or non-crack classes, extending the {"}seeds{"} to identify the complete crack shape. The paper also tests the combination of the proposed two stage crack segmentation with three smoothing techniques, to evaluate their suitability for crack detection. As a final step the system classifies the identified cracks as longitudinal, transversal or miscellaneous types. Tests performed with images acquired from different types of sensors (active and non-active), show improved crack segmentation results.},

Secondly, range images generated from point clouds are partitioned into image patches, and a learning algorithm is used to identify image patches probably containing cracks.

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a distributed cubature information filter based multi-object tracking method with an information weighted selection for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. In an UAV network, multiple UAVs can observe multiple objects in the region of interest. Further, the UAVs can exchange the objects local information among themselves and fuse them together to obtain the global state of the objects. As the number of UAVs in the network increases, the information exchange among the UAVs suffers from scalability, bandwidth and energy limitations. Thus, it is usually desirable to allow only a desired number of UAVs with highly relevant information to participate in the information exchange. In our approach, the innovation vector within the information filtering framework is used to calculate the amount of information associated with each UAV. Further, a threshold based selection mechanism is proposed to facilitate the UAVs to take independent decisions on whether to participate in the information exchange or not. In the proposed method, the UAVs take the decision to participate in the information exchange based on the information associated with a dynamic subset of objects known as priory objects while keeping the total number of information exchanges in the network to a desired number (on average).},

  abstract = {Many prediction studies using real life measurements such as wind speed, power, electricity load and rainfall utilize linear autoregressive moving average (ARMA) based models due to their simplicity and general character. However, most of the real life applications exhibit nonlinear character and modelling them with linear time series may become problematic. Among nonlinear ARMA models, polynomial ARMA (PARMA) models belong to the class of linear-in-the-parameters. In this paper, we propose a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) based complete model estimation method which estimates PARMA models with all their parameters including the nonlinearity degree. The proposed method is unique in the manner of estimating the nonlinearity degree and all other model orders and model coefficients at the same time. Moreover, in this paper, RJMCMC has been examined in an anomalous way by performing transitions between linear and nonlinear model spaces.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a robust generalization of the Gaussian quasi score test (GQST) for composite binary hypothesis testing. The proposed test, called measure-transformed GQST (MT-GQST), is based on a transformation applied to the probability distribution of the data. The considered transform is structured by a non-negative function, called MT-function, that weights the data points. By appropriate selection of the MT-function we show that, unlike the GQST, the proposed MT-GQST incorporates higher-order moments and can gain robustness to outliers. The MT-GQST is applied for testing the parameter of a non-linear model. Simulation example illustrates its advantages as compared to the standard GQST and other robust detectors.},

  title = {Blind parallel interrogation of ultrasonic neural dust motes based on canonical polyadic decomposition: A simulation study},
  year = {2017},
  pages = {2066-2070},
  abstract = {Neural dust (ND) is a wireless ultrasonic backscatter system for communicating with implanted sensor devices, referred to as ND motes (NDMs). Due to its scalability, ND could allow to chronically record electro-physiological signals in the brain cortex at a micro-scale pitch. The free-floating NDMs are read out by an array of ultrasonic (US) transducers through passive backscattering, by sequentially steering a US beam to the target NDM. In order to perform such beam steering, the NDM positions or the channels between the NDMs and the US transducers have to be estimated, which is a non-trivial task. Furthermore, such a sequential beam steering approach is too slow to sample a dense ND grid with a sufficiently high sampling rate. In this paper, we propose a new ND interrogation scheme which is fast enough to completely sample the entire ND grid, and which does not need any information on the NDM positions or the per-NDM channel characteristics. For each sample time, the US transducers transmit only a few grid-wide US beams to the entire ND grid, in which case the reflected beams will consist of mixtures of multiple NDM signals. We arrange the demodulated backscattered signals in a 3-way tensor, and then use a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) to blindly estimate the neural signals from each underlying NDM. Based on a validated simulation model, we demonstrate that this new CPD-based interrogation scheme allows to reconstruct the neural signals from the entire ND grid with a sufficiently high accuracy, even at relatively low SNR regimes.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the fact that modeling and representation of multi-class signal patterns plays a critical role in Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems, the paper proposes the coupling of error correction output coding (ECOC) with the common spatial pattern (CSP) analysis. Referred to as the ECO-CSP framework, the ECOC approach is applied to EEG motor imagery classification problem. A BCI system designed to operate in real world conditions, must be able to discriminate multiple tasks and activities. This fact, expresses the urge to develop/implement classifiers intrinsically designed for multi-class problems. One of such techniques which is well regarded in other fields but has not yet been applied to EEG-based classification is the ECOC. The paper addresses this gap. The BCI Competition IV-2a dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ECO-CSP framework. Our results show that ECO-CSP achieve similar performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms but is extensively simpler with significantly less computational overhead making it a practical alternative for real-time EEG motor imagery classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Tensor-based analysis of brain imaging data, in particular functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has proved to be quite effective in exploiting their inherently multidimensional nature. It commonly relies on a trilinear model generating the analyzed data. This assumption, however, may prove to be quite strict in practice; for example, due to the natural intra-subject and inter-subject variability of the Haemodynamic Response Function (HRF). This paper investigates the possible gains from the adoption of a less strict trilinear model, such as PARAFAC2, which allows a more flexible representation of the fMRI data in the temporal domain. In this context, and inspired by a recently reported successful application of the Block Term Decomposition (BTD) model to a 4-way tensorization of the fMRI signal, a PARAFAC2-like extension of BTD (called here BTD2) is proposed. Simulation results are presented, that reveal the pros and cons of these tensorial methods, demonstrating BTD2's enhanced robustness to noise.},

Second, a quasi systematic study of the influence of code families and of row selection is carried out on different criteria. Especially, the influence on the coherence, vital to limit the number of branches, is investigated. Additionally, an original approach that focuses on evaluating isometric properties is established. These measures are helpful since isometry is essential to noise robustness. Third, the relevance of previous high-level metrics is validated on various codes thanks to a simulation platform.

  pages = {2126-2130},
  abstract = {Inverse problems with sparsity constrains, such Basis Pursuit denoising (BPDN) and Convolutional BPDN (CBPDN), usually use the ℓ1-norm as the penalty function; however such choice leads to a solution that is biased towards zero. Recently, several works have proposed and assessed the properties of other non-standard penalty functions (most of them non-convex), which avoid the above mentioned drawback and at the same time are intended to induce sparsity more strongly than the ℓ1-norm. In this paper we propose a two-term penalty function consisting of a synthesis between the ℓ1-norm and the penalty function associated with the Non-Negative Garrote (NNG) thresholding rule. Although the proposed two-term penalty function is non-convex, the total cost function for the BPDN / CBPDN problems is still convex. The performance of the proposed two-term penalty function is compared with other reported choices for practical denoising, deconvolution and convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problems within the BPDN / CBPDN frameworks. Our experimental results show that the proposed two-term penalty function is particularly effective (better reconstruction with sparser solutions) for the CSC problem while attaining competitive performance for the denoising and deconvolution problems.},

  abstract = {An emerging issue in large-scale inverse problems is constituted by the interdependency between computational and recovery performance; in particular in practical application, such as medical imaging, it is crucial to provide high quality estimates given bounds on computational time. While most work in this direction has gone down the lines of improving optimisation schemes, in this paper we are proposing and investigating a different approach based on a multi denoising approximate message passing (MultiD-AMP) framework for Compressive Sensing (CS) image reconstruction which exploits an hierarchy of denoisers by starting with a low fidelity model and then using the estimate as starting point for a higher fidelity models through an iterative reconstruction algorithm. MultiD-AMP achieves lower time complexity and same accuracy compared to using the same most accurate denoiser as in D-AMP. The novelty of our approach is based on exploiting the deterministic state evolution of AMP, which means the predictability of the recovery performances, to design a strategy for selecting the denoiser from a set ordered by both computational complexity and statistical efficiency. We apply the MultiD-AMP framework for image reconstruction given noisy Gaussian random linear measurements. Furthermore, we extend and show the applicability of MultiD-AMP for CS to image reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The concept of dictionary expansion has been applied in inverse problems as a means to overcome a problem known as off-grid deviation. Within this framework and under the assumption that the off-grid deviations obey an uniform distribution, we propose a minimax error criterion to build expanded dictionaries. To this end, we formulate the problem as a polynomial regression and cast it as a second-order cone program. A robust method for the recovery of continuous time shifts and amplitudes from reconstructed expanded coefficients is also presented. Empirical results with a greedy algorithm and a convex optimization algorithm, both conceived to work with expanded dictionaries, show that the proposed expanded basis provides accurate reconstruction of continuous-time located events in the presence of noise.},

  abstract = {Data representation plays an important role in performance of machine learning algorithms. Since data usually lacks the desired quality, many efforts have been made to provide a more desirable representation of data. Among many different approaches, sparse data representation has gained popularity in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new sparse autoencoder by imposing the power two of smoothed L0 norm of data representation on the hidden layer of regular autoencoder. The square of smoothed L0 norm increases the tendency that each data representation is {"}individually{"} sparse. Moreover, by using the proposed sparse autoencoder, once the model parameters are learned, the sparse representation of any new data is obtained simply by a matrix-vector multiplication without performing any optimization. When applied to the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and OPTDIGITS datasets, the results show that the proposed model guarantees a sparse representation for each input data which leads to better classification results.},

This problem can also be seen as a sparse decomposition problem. Traditional sparse decomposition gives the same priority to all atoms for being included in the decomposition or not. However, in some applications, one may want to assign different priorities to different atoms for being included in the decomposition. This results to the so called {"}weighted sparse decomposition{"} problem [Babaie-Zadeh et al. 2012]. However, Babaie-Zadeh et al. studied this problem only for positive weights; but in some applications (e.g. classification) better performance can be obtained if some weights become negative. In this paper, we consider {"}weighted sparse decomposition{"} problem in its general form (positive and negative weights). A tight uniqueness condition and some applications for the general case will be presented.},

  abstract = {For a wideband radar system adopting stepped frequency signal (SFS), the micro-motion parameter is usually obtained by time-frequency analysis of the echo HRRPs (high resolution profiles). The data to be collected mainly includes each sub-frequency echo in the slow-time domain, which brings a great burden to the signal generation equipment and data storage on the radar system. Because of the sparseness of the ballistic target scatters in high frequency area, this paper adopts the compressed sensing technique to reduce the sampling data by randomly transmitting the stepped frequency signal. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed by the precession target measurement experiment in the anechoic chamber. The experimental results show that for the nose cone, middle circular ring and bottom circular ring of experimental missile target, when the sampling rate is no less than 50%, 30% and 30% respectively, the reconstruction result is qualified for micro-motion parameter extraction.},

A typical approach is to process each signal sequentially and independently, with an arbitrary sparsity level fixed for each signal.

We propose a multivariate sparse coding approach, where sparsity is enforced on average across several frames. We propose a Multivariate Iterative Hard Thresholding to solve this problem.

The convex relaxation of that problem, typically used to reduce complexity, is strictly equivalent with the original problem only when certain conditions are met, such as Restricted Isometry Property, Null Space Characterization, and Block Mutual Coherence. In practice, those conditions may not be satisfied, which implies that solving the relaxed problem may not retrieve the block sparsest solution. In this paper, we propose a weighted approach, which, in the noise free case and under certain conditions guarantees that the relaxed problem solution has the same support as the sparsest block vector.

  year = {2017},
  pages = {2166-2170},
  abstract = {The conventional physical-layer (PHY) security approaches, e.g., transmit beamforming and artificial noise (AN)-based design, may fail when the channels of legitimate user (LU) and eavesdropper (Eve) are close correlated. Due to the highly directional transmission feature of millimeter-wave (mmWave), this may occur in mmWave transmissions as the transmitter, Eve and LU are aligned in the same direction exactly. To handle the PHY security problem with directionally-aligned LU and Eve, we propose a novel frequency diverse array (FDA) beamforming approach to differentiating the LU and Eve. By intentionally introducing some frequency offsets across the antennas, the FDA beamforming generates an angle-range dependent beampattern. As a consequence, it can degrade the Eve's reception and thus achieve PHY security. In this paper, we maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets and the beamformer. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is hard to solve due to the tightly coupled variables. Nevertheless, we show that it can be reformulated into a form depending only on the frequency offsets. Building upon this reformulation, we identify some cases where the SRM problem can be optimally solved in closed form. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of FDA beamforming in achieving PHY security, even for aligned LU and Eve.},

The need of authenticating these contents and tracing back their history has led to the investigation of forensic algorithms for the reconstruction of the video phylogeny tree (VPT), i.e., an acyclic directed graph summarizing video genealogical relationships. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art solutions for VPT reconstruction suffer from strong computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a processing age measure based on video DCT coefficients and motion vectors statistics, which enables to provide preliminary information about possible video parent-child relationship. The use of processing age allows a forensic analyst to blindly select a smaller amount of significant video pairs to be compared for VPT reconstruction. This solution grants computational complexity reduction to the overall VPT reconstruction pipeline.},

  abstract = {Multi-biometrics aims at building more accurate unified biometric decisions based on the information provided by multiple biometric sources. Information fusion is used to optimize the process of creating this unified decision. In previous works dealing with score-level multi-biometric fusion, the scores of different biometric sources belonging to the comparison of interest are used to create the fused score. This is usually achieved by assigning static weights for the different biometric sources with more advanced solutions considering supplementary dynamic information like sample quality and neighbours distance ratio. This work proposes embedding score coherence information in the fusion process. This is based on our assumption that a minority of biometric sources, which points out towards a different decision than the majority, might have faulty conclusions and should be given relatively smaller role in the final decision. The evaluation was performed on the BioSecure multimodal biometric database with different levels of simulated noise. The proposed solution incorporates, and was compared to, three baseline static weighting approaches. The enhanced performance induced by including the coherence information within a dynamic weighting scheme in comparison to the baseline solution was shown by the reduction of the equal error rate by 45% to 85% over the different test scenarios and proved to maintain high performance when dealing with noisy data.},

SCREAM is able to extract a few latent variables from multi-way data and compute regression coefficients. Initially, biologically inspired features are extracted from speech utterances and face images and are suitable feature matrices are created to be fed to the multi-way SCREAM model. For bimodal age estimation, the visual and aural features are appropriately combined in a single matrix for each person. Experimental results demonstrate the profit of combining the two modalities.

In this respect, recent studies have examined feasibility of inferring user's tap input by utilizing the motion sensor readings and propounded that some user secrets can be deduced by adopting the different side-channel attacks. More precisely, in this kind of attacks, a malware processes outputs of these sensors to exfiltrate victims private information such as PINs, passwords or unlock patterns. In this paper, we describe a new side-channel attack on smartphones that aims to predict the age interval of the user. Unlike the previous works, our attack does not directly deal with recovering a target user's some secret, rather its sole purpose is determining whether she is a child or an adult. The main idea behind our study relies on the key observation that the characteristics of children and adults differ in hand holding and touching the smartphones. Consequently, we show that there is an apparent correlation between the motion sensor readings and these characteristics that build up our attack strategy. In order to exhibit efficiency of the proposed attack, we have developed an Android application named as BalloonLogger that evaluates accelerometer sensor data and perform child/adult detection with a success rate of 92.5%. To the best of our knowledge, in this work, for the first time, we point out such a security breach.},

However, the established communication channel can be eavesdropped and manipulated by an attacker. To prevent this, we introduce a tailored protocol with smallest possible overhead to secure the communication. The proposed protocol produces an overhead of 256 bits for the handshake message for setting up the first conversation with each partner. Further, the protocol produces [msg_len/64]* 3 + 67 bits overhead for each message. The overhead of 67 bits at the beginning of each message corresponds to one second transmission time with the used FSK modulation in the frequency range of 16kHz-20kHz. The additional overhead of 3-bit per 64-bit sequence poses a relation of 95% message to 5% overhead. For the implementation of the protocol, algorithms implemented in the Crypto++ library such as SHA-256, CCM and PBKDF2 have been used.},

We assume a target to have a range-walk of a few range cells during the coherent processing interval, when observed by wideband radar with high range resolution. Two CFAR detectors are proposed assuming different correlation properties of clutter over range. The detectors' performance is studied via numerical simulations and a significant improvement over existing techniques is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {A random Phase Center Motion (PCM) technique is presented in this paper, based on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, in order to suppress the angle-Doppler coupling in Time Division Multiplex (TDM) Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar when employing sparse array structures. The presented approach exploits an apparently moving transmit platform or PCM due to spatio-temporal transmit array modulation. In particular, the work considers a framework utilizing a random PCM trajectory. The statistical characterization of the random PCM trajectory is devised, such that the PCM and the target motion coupling is minimal, while the angular resolution is increased by enabling the virtual MIMO concept. In more details, this paper discusses sidelobe suppression approaches within the angle-Doppler Ambiguity Function (AF) by introducing a phase center probability density function within the array. This allows for enhanced discrimination of multiple targets. Simulation results demonstrate the suppression angle-Doppler coupling by more than 30 dB, even though spatio-temporal transmit array modulation is done across chirps which leads usually to strong angle-Doppler coupling.},

G.fast testbed experiments show that on average the difference between the attainable net data rates (AttNDR) prequalfied by our algorithm and reported by G.fast systems is 5%. Furthermore, on average the GeoLATN-based prequalification outperforms the LATN-based prequalification by 5% in terms of AttNDR.},

We propose a Student's t time-frequency source model based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The Student's t distribution being heavy-tailed with respect to the Gaussian, it provides some flexibility in the modeling of the sources. We also study a simpler Student's t sparse source model within the same general source separation framework. The inference procedure relies on a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiments show the advantage of using an NMF model compared with the sparse source model. While the Student's t NMF source model leads to slightly better results than our previous Gaussian one, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over two other approaches from the literature.},

The proposed approach allows the associated convex sets to be updated at every iteration of the algorithm, thus resulting into a faster agreement of the nodes in a common dictionary. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in computing a common dictionary, in a scenario where the data of the nodes are significantly different and a second scenario, in which the nodes have the same data.},

  abstract = {The tracking and labeling of multiple objects in multiple cameras is a fundamental task in applications such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analysis. In an ad-hoc multi-camera network without a fusion center nodes can benefit from local cooperation to solve signal processing tasks, such as distributed image enhancement. A crucial first step for the successful cooperation of neighboring nodes is to answer the question: Who observes what?. In this paper, an adaptive algorithm is proposed that enables cameras with different view points to assign the same identity to the same object across time frames without assuming the availability of camera calibration information or requiring the registration of camera views. Information which is extracted directly from the videos and is shared in the network via a diffusion algorithm is exploited to jointly solve multi-object tracking and labeling problems in a multi-camera network. A real-data use case of pedestrian labeling is provided, which demonstrates that a high labeling accuracy can be achieved in a multi-object multi-camera setup with low video resolution and frequent object occlusions.},

Statistical correlations present in data that contain similar information are exploited to perform the clustering task. Specifically, multiset canonical correlation analysis is equipped with norm-one regularization mechanisms to identify clusters within different types of data that share the same information content. A pertinent minimization formulation is put forth, while block coordinate descent is employed to derive a batch clustering algorithm which achieves better clustering performance than existing alternatives. Distributed implementations are also considered to cluster spatially clustered data utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers. Relying on subgradient descent, an online clustering approach is derived which substantially lowers computational complexity compared to the batch approaches. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform existing alternatives.},

We use offline-trained log-power spectrum global priors incorporated in the Kalman filter prediction and update steps for enhancing noise suppression. In particular, we train and utilize Gaussian mixture model priors for speech in the log-spectral domain that are normalized with respect to the active speech level. The Kalman filter update step uses the log-power spectrum global priors together with the local priors obtained from the Kalman filter prediction step. The logspectrum Kalman filtering algorithm, which uses the theoretical phase factor distribution and improves the modeling of the modulation features, is evaluated in terms of speech quality. Different algorithm configurations, dependent on whether global priors and/or Kalman filter noise tracking are used, are compared in various noise types.},

  abstract = {Conventional noise suppression methods based on array signal processing use phase information and control the directivity of noises. However, such methods can hardly suppress so-called background noise, whose arrival direction cannot be specified. Thus, multiple far noise suppression based on transfer-function-gain non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been proposed as a method that can suppress such background noise. Its effectiveness has been confirmed by an experimental simulation using convolutional mixtures; however, it has not been verified that it is practical in a real environment. Thus, in this paper, we examine the performance of this method by recording a target and multiple far noises with asynchronous microphones in a real environment. We confirm that this method can suppress far noises in a real environment with diverse distances between microphones and interference sources.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a maximum signal-to-noise ratio beamformer based on a virtual increase of channels. We previously proposed a new microphone array signal processing technique, which virtually increases the number of microphones by generating extra signal channels from two real microphone signals. This technique generates a virtual observation on the assumption that the sources are W-disjoint orthogonal, which means that only one source is dominant in one time-frequency bin. However, mixed signals with a long reverberation tend to dissatisfy this assumption. In this study, we conducted experiments in a variety of reverberant environments, as well as computer simulation using image method. As a result, we confirmed that our technique contributes improving the performance in reverberant environments. We also confirmed that the longer the reverberation time, the smaller the increase in the improvement using our technique. Moreover, we present directivity patterns to confirm the behavior of a virtual increase of channels.},

The source model of IVA generally assumes the same amount of statistical dependency on each pair of frequency bins, which is not effective for speech signals with strong correlations among neighboring frequency bins. In the proposed model, the set of all frequency bins is divided into frequency bands, and the statistical dependency is assumed only within each band to better represent speech signals. In addition, each source prior is switched depending on the source states, active or inactive, since intermittent silent periods have totally different priors from those of speech periods. The optimization of the model is based on an EM algorithm, in which the IVA filters, states of sources, and permutation alignments between each pair of bands are jointly optimized. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

To this end, we employ rigid parts mixtures model of an instrument. The rigidly composed parts encode diverse, pose-specific appearance mixtures of the tool. Tracking search space is confined to the neighbourhood of tool position, scale, and rotation with respect to previous best estimate such that the rotation constraint translates into querying subset of templates. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {In the field of signal processing, pattern recognition and also modeling and simulation, it is often necessary to use large data sets. These allow reliable, independent and test case spanning development of algorithms or even of complete systems. The data is usually taken from existing data sets such as TIMIT for speech recognition and processing or EPILEPSIAE to develop algorithms for epileptic seizure prediction, to give just two examples. Apart from the fact that some of these databases imply a considerable cost factor and thus are not accessible to all research groups, even greater problems arise if no data is available at all. In the field of speech recognition, this problem was solved more or less by creating databases. In the area of biosignal processing with a focus on the functionalization of furniture for care and clinical facilities, there is still a need for large data sets. This was also the case with biomechanical modeling of functionalized furniture, since up to now none or few data on the human movement sequences were available. In order to overcome this deficiency, the following paper presents a new database of motion patterns, which is intended to support the development of algorithms for motion detection as well as modeling biosignal processing. The database can be used and downloaded by any interested researcher for free.},

This condition is commonly found in critically ill patients from intensive care units and constitutes a medical emergency. This paper proposes a method to detect nonconvulsive epileptic seizures (NCES). To perform the NCES detection the electroencephalogram (EEG) is represented as a third order tensor with axes frequency χ time χ channels using Wavelet or Hilbert-Huang transform. The signatures obtained from the tensor decomposition are used to train five classifiers to separate between the normal and seizure EEG. Classification is performed in two ways: (1) with each signature of the different modes separately, (2) with all signatures assembled. The algorithm is tested on a database containing 139 nonconvulsive seizures. From all performed analysis, Hilbert-Huang Tensors Space and assembled signatures demonstrate to be the best features to classify between seizure and non-seizure EEG.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {2378-2382},
  abstract = {A classical problem in hyperspectral imaging, referred to as hyperspectral unmixing, consists in estimating spectra associated with each material present in an image and their proportions in each pixel. In practice, illumination variations (e.g., due to declivity or complex interactions with the observed materials) and the possible presence of outliers can result in significant changes in both the shape and the amplitude of the measurements, thus modifying the extracted signatures. In this context, sequences of hyperspectral images are expected to be simultaneously affected by such phenomena when acquired on the same area at different time instants. Thus, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously account for smooth and abrupt spectral variations affecting a set of multitemporal hyperspectral images to be jointly unmixed. This model assumes that smooth variations can be interpreted as the result of endmember variability, whereas abrupt variations are due to significant changes in the imaged scene (e.g., presence of outliers, additional endmembers, etc.). The parameters of this Bayesian model are estimated using samples generated by a Gibbs sampler according to its posterior. Performance assessment is conducted on synthetic data in comparison with state-of-the-art unmixing methods.},

  abstract = {The image restoration problem deals with images in which information has been degraded by blur or noise. In this work, we present a new method for image deblurring by solving a regularized linear least-squares problem. In the proposed method, a synthetic perturbation matrix with a bounded norm is forced into the discrete ill-conditioned model matrix. This perturbation is added to enhance the singular-value structure of the matrix and hence to provide an improved solution. A method is proposed to find a near-optimal value of the regularization parameter for the proposed approach. To reduce the computational complexity, we present a technique based on the bootstrapping method to estimate the regularization parameter for both low and high-resolution images. Experimental results on the image deblurring problem are presented. Comparisons are made with three benchmark methods and the results demonstrate that the proposed method clearly outperforms the other methods in terms of both the output PSNR and SSIM values.},

  abstract = {The goal of pattern matching is to find small parts of an image that are similar to a given template. Matching in transform-domain (such as Haar, Walsh-Hadamard, etc.) is more efficient that matching in the spatial domain. However, it has a limitation: the template size is restricted to be a power of two to apply fast computational algorithms of transforms. In this paper, fast pattern matching method based on orthonormal tree-structured Haar transform (OTSHT) is proposed. It allows to overcome the above-mentioned limitation of the template size. Two types of tree structures are considered in this paper: balanced tree and logarithmic tree. It is demonstrated that the proposed method with the balanced tree structure is computationally more efficient.},

In this paper, we propose to solve this drawback by considering sparse priors. In the experimental part of this paper, by using numerical simulations of plane waves subject to coherence loss, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms a classical beamformer in terms of source localization performance, but also, that it improves the antenna resolution.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a sound source separation method for vibration-derived sound signals such as sounds derived from mechanical vibrations by using vibration sensors. The proposed method is based on two assumptions. First, a vibration signal and the sound derived from the vibration are assumed to have a linear correlation. This assumption enables us to model the vibration-derived sound as a linear convolution of a transfer function and a vibration signal recorded by a vibration sensor. Second, un-vibration-derived sound signals such that the sound source is not connected to vibration sensors via a solid medium are barely recorded by vibration sensors. This assumption leads to a constraint of the transfer function from the un-vibration-derived sound sources to the vibration sensors. The proposed framework is the same as a microphone-array-based blind source separation framework, except that the proposed method constructs arrays with microphones and vibration sensors, and the separation parameters are constrained by the prior knowledge gained from the above second assumption. Experimental results indicate that the separation performance of the proposed method is superior to that of a conventional microphone-array-based source separation method.},

This methodology is applied for the purposes of speaker diarization. In general, speaker diarization has difficulty with: 1) estimating the number of sound sources (speakers), and 2) activity detection of multiple sound sources including overlap of utterances. Several microphone array based techniques have already tackled these challenges. However, existing methods mainly assume that the steering vectors for the microphone array are calibrated in advance to identify sound sources, which is difficult to satisfy when ad-hoc or flexible microphone arrays are used. Thus our approach estimates the number of sound sources blindly in two steps. First, Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) of the observed signal is clustered. Second, the sound source activity is detected by clustering the long-term spatial spectrum using the TDOA based steering vector for each cluster. The validity of the algorithm is confirmed by both synthesized signals and a real-world flexible microphone array application.},

  abstract = {The design of massive MIMO, especially at millimeter waves, requires a trade-off between cost and power consumption, balancing the complexity and the performance in terms of achievable rate. A recent trend in the design is to split the pre-coding at the transmitter and the combining at the receiver into a digital and analog part, with hybrid analog-digital schemes. In this paper the effect of phase noise is considered in the design of different hybrid analog-digital alternatives to implement massive MIMO, in particular at very high frequencies. Its effect depending on the number of RF chains, oscillators, and groups of antennas is analyzed providing some insights for the system design. In order to limit the penalty introduced by the phase noise to values below 6 dB, with a number of antennas around 64, the value of phase noise increment variance should be limited below 0.005. This limit is slightly lower in a simplified architecture with more blocks driven by independent oscillators.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {2463-2470},
  abstract = {Image deblurring techniques are effective tools to obtain high quality image from acquired image degraded by blur and noise. In applications such as astronomy and satellite imaging, size of acquired images can be extremely large (up to gigapixels) covering a wide field-of-view suffering from shift-variant blur. Most of the existing deblurring techniques are designed to be cost effective on a centralized computing system having a shared memory and possibly multicore processor. The largest image they can handle is then conditioned by the memory capacity of the system. In this paper, we propose a distributed shift-variant image deblurring algorithm in which several connected processing units (each with reasonable computational resources) can deblur simultaneously different portions of a large image while maintaining a certain coherency among them to finally obtain a single crisp image. The proposed algorithm is based on a distributed Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm with a specific structure of the penalty parameters used in the proximity operator. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm produces images of similar quality as the existing centralized techniques while being distributed and being cost effective for extremely large images.},

A number of solutions have been proposed for indoor localisation but most rely on specialised hardware or on the presence of a strong (access point) infrastructure. Many places do not have such infrastructure, thus limiting the use of these indoor localisation technologies. We propose a smartphone-based solution using FM and Wi-Fi signals that uses commercial off-the-shelf hardware which can be connected as and when required and thus addresses some of the potential privacy concerns. We show through our experiments that the proposed system can be used even in areas with low FM and Wi-Fi signal coverage. Our system achieves a mean localisation error of 2.84 m with a 90th percentile error of 4.03 m. In addition, we show the robustness of our system in a realistic and challenging environment by using a 4 month old training database.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound testing techniques, either nondestructive (NDT) or medical, suffer from spatial signal attenuation, where equivalent scatterers at different distances from the transducer will display different signal amplitudes. If not corrected, these differences may lead to erroneously interpretation. In NDT, Time Corrected Gain (TCG) compensates for spatial attenuation by increasing input gain according to the expected attenuation. Because TCG does not consider noise, signals coming from far scatterers are highly amplified, and so is noise. Wiener filter, on the other hand, deal with noise optimally, but does not compensate for spatial attenuation. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive TCG that combines the amplitude correction of the TCG with the optimality of the Wiener filter. We present simulations to evaluate the robustness of the proposed technique, as well as real-word results showing the proposed method is superior to both Wiener filter and classical TCG independently.},

In this model, the input vector represents the location of the geometrical center of the discontinuity and the scattering amplitude of the discontinuity is embedded in the impulse response of the ultrasonic inspection system. First, we jointly estimate the locations and the scattering amplitudes of the discontinuities from the acquired signals. Then, the geometrical parameters of the discontinuities are calculated from the estimated scattering amplitude. The method is tested to characterize side-drilled holes using both synthetic and real data. The results demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Caching is a technique to reduce the peak network load by pre-fetching some popular contents at the local caches of end users. Coded caching can facilitate and exploit the coded-multicasting opportunities for users with different demands, resulting in an additional and significant reduction of the peak traffic. However, most existing researches on coded caching are limited by the assumption that all files to be delivered have the same size. We show in this paper that current schemes can only achieve suboptimal performance when the files have different sizes. To address this, we propose a novel optimization strategy for coded caching that minimizes the worst-case transmission rate of multicasting the coded content upon users requests, subject to the storage constraint at the local caches, by the optimal allocation of the caching proportion among heterogeneous files. In order to efficiently solve this problem, we develop a practical algorithm by using the Lagrange multiplier method and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach. Experiment results show that the worst-case transmission rate can be reduced by the proposed scheme compared to state-of-the-art coded caching schemes. It certainly offers an important advantage in the deployment of data delivery systems.},

  year = {2017},
  pages = {2536-2540},
  abstract = {Meeting the challenges of 5G demands better exploitation of the available spectrum by allowing multiple parties to share resources. For instance, a secondary unlicensed system can share resources with the cellular uplink of a primary licensed system for an improved spectral efficiency. This induces interference which has to be taken into account when designing such a system. A simple yet robust strategy is treating interference as noise (TIN), which is widely adapted in practice. It is thus important to study the capabilities and limitations of TIN in such scenarios. In this paper, we study this scenario modelled as multiple access channel (MAC) interfered by a Point-to-Point (P2P) channel, where we focus on the characterization of the rate region. We use improper Gaussian signaling (instead of proper) at the transmitters to increase the design flexibility, which offers the freedom of optimizing the transmit signal pseudo-variance in addition to its variance.

  abstract = {The multi-input single-output multi-eavesdropper (MISOME) wiretap channel is one of the generic wiretap channels in physical layer security. In Khisti and Wornell's classical work [1], the optimal secure beamformer for MISOME has been derived under the total power constraint. In this work, we revisit the MISOME wiretap channel and focus on the large-scale transmit antenna regime and the constant modulus beamformer design. The former is motivated by the significant spectral efficiency gains provided by massive antennas, and the latter is due to the consideration of cheap hardware implementation of constant modulus beamforming. However, from an optimization point of view, the secrecy beamforming with constant modulus constraints is challenging, more specifically, NP-hard. In light of this, we propose two methods to tackle it, namely the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the ADMM-Dinkelbach method. Simulation results demonstrate that the ADMM-Dinkelbach method outperforms the SDR method, and can attain nearly optimal secrecy performance for the large-scale antenna scenario.},

  abstract = {Mobile traffic in cellular based networks is increasing exponentially, mainly due to the use of data intensive services like video. Network operators are urged to explore new technologies in order to enhance the capacity, data rates and maximizing the utilization of available spectrum resources. One effective way to cope with these demands is to reduce the cell-size by deploying small-cells along the coverage area of the current macro-cell system. In this paper, we consider the uplink of heterogeneous network with a number of small-cells coexist with a macro-cell under the same frequency band. To deal with intertier/system interference, we combine signal alignment (SA) based precoding at the small-cell transmitters in conjunction with physical network coding (PNC) at the macro-receiver. The joint design of SA and PNC provides higher system degrees of freedom (DoF), than the case where only PNC or interference alignment (IA) is employed individually. The results show that the proposed scheme is robust to inter-tier/system interference while allowing to increase the overall data rate, by serving more users, as compared with the IA based methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a robust representation of a digital signal based on error correction codes. For each frame of the signal (N successive samples) a binary decomposition, as a (successive power 2) weighted sum of binary vectors, is first considered. Then, each binary vector is projected into the set of codewords of a corresponding block code. The codes are designed so that their correction powers increases inversely to the weight of the binary vectors since the binary vectors with high weight are less sensitive to disturbance. The corresponding representation (decoding) thus appears as a form of signal quantization that can provide an interesting protection against noise and/or channel distorsion. Some applications showing the utility of the proposed representation are given.},

The positioning problem is typically solved in a two-step approach where in the first step the Time of Arrival (TOA) is estimated independently at each anchor, and the position estimate is found in a second step. However, this approach can be improved, especially in challenging scenarios, if the positioning problem is treat as a whole, that is, the target position is estimated directly from the signals received on each anchor (Direct Position estimation DPE). In this paper, we present a different approach that sits halfway between these two approaches. The algorithm is based on a soft two-steps approach, where several possible TOA estimators are selected in the first step, and then the best estimators are used to find the position. The performance of the method is assessed under the framework of the IEEE 802.15.4a channel models.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is one of the most promising techniques for optimizing the spectrum usage. However, the large amount of data of spectral information that must be processed to identify and assign spectral resources increases the channel assignment times, therefore worsening the quality of service for the devices using the spectrum. Compressive Sensing (CS) is a digital processing technique that allows the reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals using fewer samples than those required traditionally. This paper presents a model that addresses the Spectral Sensing problem in Cognitive Radio using Compressive Sensing as an effective way of decreasing the number of samples required in the sensing process. This model is based on Compressive Spectral Imaging (CSI) architectures where a centralized spectrum manager selects what power data must be delivered by the different wireless devices using binary patterns, and builds a multispectral data cube image with the geographical and spectral data power information. The results show that this multispectral data cube can be built with only a 50% of the samples generated by the devices and, therefore reducing the data traffic dramatically.},

To mitigate these effects, we propose the employment of non-binary turbo codes, since non-binary error-correcting codes generally promise an enhanced performance in such harsh environments. In this paper, we investigate the performance of non-binary turbo-codes on PLC channels that exhibit frequency selectivity with additive Middleton Class A noise and compare with a comparable binary turbo-coded PLC system. In order to reduce the effect of multipath and impulsive noise, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with non-linear receivers (blanking and clipping) have been employed. The system is examined on extremely impulsive channels where the value of the impulsive index (A) is 0.01 and the noise ratio (Γ) is 0.01. The results show that non-binary turbo codes are very robust and achieve a large gain over binary turbo codes on PLC channels.},

The considered channel non-reciprocity model covers both the frequency-response and the mutual coupling mismatches between the transmitter and the receiver chains of a massive MIMO basestation (BS). Based on the assumed non-reciprocity model, it is shown that the effective downlink channel can be decomposed as a product of the uplink channel and another sparse matrix, referred to as the BS transceiver non-reciprocity matrix. Stemming from such modeling, we then propose an efficient estimator of the BS transceiver non-reciprocity matrix exploiting its sparse nature, combined with an appropriate formulation of the associated over-the-air pilot-signaling. The mean-squared error performance of the overall corresponding estimation method is finally evaluated using extensive computer simulations which indicate that the non-reciprocity characteristics can be estimated efficiently and accurately, thus potentially facilitating large system-level performance gains in multi-user massive MIMO systems.},

The aim is to find an encoding scheme (linear combinations) to minimize the number of transmitted packets, while providing each user with sufficient amount of data for the recovery of the desired parts. It has been shown that finding the optimal linear index code is equivalent to a matrix completion problem, where the observed elements of the matrix indicate the side information available for the users. This modeling results in an incomplete square matrix with all ones on the main diagonal (and some other parts), which needs to be completed with minimum rank. Unfortunately, this is a case in which conventional matrix completion techniques based on nuclear-norm minimization are proved to fail [Huang, Rouayheb 2015]. Instead, an alternating projection (the AP algorithm) method is proposed in [Huang, Rouayheb 2015]. In this paper, in addition to proving the convergence of the AP algorithm under certain conditions, we introduce a modification which considerably improves the run time of the method.},

This task becomes more difficult when the sensors have gain/phase uncertainty. We have addressed this issue by modeling the problem as a combination of two sparse components, the DOA vector and the gain/phase uncertainty vector. Therefore, a sparse decomposition technique is suggested to jointly recover the DOAs and the sensors with gain/phase uncertainty. The simulation results confirm that the suggested method offers very good performance in different scenarios and is superior to its counterparts.},

  abstract = {In a recent work, we addressed the identification poblem of bilinear forms with the Wiener filter. In this context, a different approach was introduced, by defining the bilinear term with respect to the impulse responses of a spatiotemporal model, which resembles a multiple-input/single-output (MISO) system. However, in practice, the Wiener filter may not be always very efficient or convenient to use. Consequently, in this paper, we further develop a normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) adaptive filter tailored for bilinear forms. Many simulations, which are performed from a system identification perspective, indicate the good performance of the proposed algorithm.},

The ALE, however, is not designed for detection of two-(2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) periodic signals such as tremor in an unconstrained hand motion. An ALE which can perform restoration of 3-D periodic signals is therefore required for such purposes. These signals may not exhibit periodicity in a single dimension.

Both the convergence analysis and the steady-state performance analysis are derived. More importantly, unlike other stochastic based algorithms, the step size parameter that controls the convergence of the QNLMF is independent of the statistics of the input signal, and consequently, the analytical assessments show that the proposed algorithm enjoys an independent performance from the input signal eigenvalue spread. Finally, a number of simulation experiments are carried out to corroborate the theoretical findings.},

  pages = {2649-2653},
  abstract = {Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) allows identifying large-scale functional brain networks based on spontaneous activity and their temporal reconfigurations. Due to limited memory and computational resources, these pairwise measures are typically computed for a set of brain regions from a pre-defined brain atlas, which choice is non-trivial and might influence results. Here, we first leverage the availability of dynamic information and new computational methods to retrieve dFC at the finest voxel level in terms of dominant patterns of fluctuations, and, second, we demonstrate that this new representation is informative to derive meaningful brain parcellations that capture both long-range interactions and fine-scale local organization. We analyzed resting-state fMRI of 54 healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project. For each position of a temporal window, we determined eigenvector centrality of the windowed fMRl data at the voxel level. These were then concatenated across time and subjects and clustered into the most representative dominant patterns (RDPs). Each voxel was then labeled according to a binary code indicating positive or negative contribution to each of the RDPs. We obtained a 36-label parcellation displaying long-range interactions with remarkable hemispherical symmetry. By separating contiguous regions, a finer-scale parcellation of 448 areas was also retrieved, showing consistency with known connectivity of cortical/subcortical structures including thalamus. Our contribution bridges the gap between voxel-based approaches and graph theoretical analysis.},

In this manuscript, we use an established method for the characterization of 3D collagen networks at fiber resolution in confocal reflection microscopy images. Firstly, a binary mask of the entire network is obtained using steerable filtering and local Otsu thresholding. Secondly, individual collagen fibers are reconstructed by tracking maximum ridges in the Euclidean distance map of the binary mask. The approach was applied to quantify the 3D network geometry of hydrogels polymerized with different collagen concentrations in two in vitro platforms: an eight-well culture plate and a microfluidic device. Our results shown similar fiber lengths, fiber persistence lengths and cross-link densities for the fibers of the collagen hydrogels polymerized in different platforms for the same concentration, while the differences on the pore size are large reflecting on the anisotropy of the network polymerized on the microfluidic device.},

  pages = {2674-2678},
  abstract = {In kernel methods, temporal information on the data is commonly included by using time-delayed embeddings as inputs. Recently, an alternative formulation was proposed by defining a γ-filter explicitly in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, giving rise to a complex model where multiple kernels operate on different temporal combinations of the input signal. In the original formulation, the kernels are then simply combined to obtain a single kernel matrix (for instance by averaging), which provides computational benefits but discards important information on the temporal structure of the signal. Inspired by works on multiple kernel learning, we overcome this drawback by considering the different kernels separately. We propose an efficient strategy to adaptively combine and select these kernels during the training phase. The resulting batch and online algorithms automatically learn to process highly nonlinear temporal information extracted from the input signal, which is implicitly encoded in the kernel values. We evaluate our proposal on several artificial and real tasks, showing that it can outperform classical approaches both in batch and online settings.},

They overcome the problem of the locality of the solution, i.e., the fact that the estimated model well approximates the system only at the same input signal variance of the measurement. The estimation of a kernel for a certain input signal variance requires recomputing all lower order kernels. In this paper, a novel multivariance identification method based on Wiener basis functions is proposed to avoid recomputing the lower order kernels with computational saving. Formulas are provided for evaluating the Volterra kernels from the Wiener multivariance kernels. In order to further improve the nonlinear filter estimation, perfect periodic sequences that guarantee the orthogonality of the Wiener basis functions are used for Wiener kernel identification.

A nonlinear IIR filter is a nonlinear compensator and is based on a physical nonlinear model of electrodynamic loudspeakers. However, it is difficult to compensate nonlinear distortions when a loudspeaker has large sharpness at the lowest resonance frequency, at which the displacement of the diaphragm becomes large. Although it is necessary to compensate the sharpness of the loudspeaker, the nonlinear IIR filter cannot compensate the sharpness because it does not have a linear filtering feature. In this paper, we propose a modified 2nd-order nonlinear IIR filter that can compensate not only the nonlinear distortions but also the sharpness by employing the linear characteristics of the loudspeaker with the desired sharpness. Experimental results show that the proposed filter can compensate the linear and nonlinear distortions more effectively than a conventional filter.},

  abstract = {In Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), ionospheric scintillation is one of the more challenging propagation scenarios, particularly affecting high-precision receivers based on carrier phase measurements. In this contribution, we propose a new digital carrier synchronization state-space formulation for the mitigation of strong scintillation. It takes into account multi-frequency GNSS observations, allowing tracking of both line-of-sight phase variations and complex gain scintillation components, that is, scintillation amplitude and phase. The joint carrier tracking and scintillation mitigation problem is solved using a multi-frequency nonlinear Kalman filter-based solution. The performance improvement of the new approach is shown using realistic synthetic data, and compared to state-of-the-art PLL and KF-based architectures.},

  abstract = {Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is one of the major barriers to accurate ranging and positioning based on time of arrival (TOA) in the application of an ultra wideband (UWB) system. This paper proposes a new method for NLOS identification and mitigation based on signal characteristic analysis and fuzzy theory. This method neither requires to build a statistical model nor to create and update a training database, so that it can be used conveniently for different application scenarios. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results show that the cumulative distribution function of the ranging error below 0.5 meter is over 90% when using the proposed mitigation method, while that without using the mitigation method is below 70%. Also, by using the proposed method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the range measurements is reduced from 0.77 to 0.33 meter. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively identify NLOS and mitigate the NLOS-induced ranging error.},

These systems use an array of loudspeakers and design the required filters at each loudspeaker in order to render the desired audio signal to each person in the room as free of interferences as possible. There are very interesting proposals in the literature that make use of circular or linear arrays, but in this paper we study the problem considering a network of distributed loudspeakers controlled by a set of acoustic nodes, which can exchange information through a network. We state the model of such a distributed system by considering the electro-acoustic paths between the loudspeakers and each microphone, and try to provide a minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) to each zone, but constraining the emitted power of the loudspeakers to a maximum value (avoiding annoying feedback effects). We make use of optimization techniques to decide if, given a distribution of the loudspeakers and a location of the personal sound zones within the room, the system will be feasible. Simulations are done to support the use of the proposed optimization techniques.},

And, when combined with UBM, the error rate was reduced by a factor of three, showing that the voice source information is largely independent of the information contained in the MFCC, yet holds as much speaker-related information. We now describe how GLOMM can be adapted for telephone quality audio and provide significant error reduction when combined with UBM and I-vector approaches.

So far, this observation has been accepted as a fact and we lack of a careful analysis. In this paper, we reason the rationale behind this fact and, more importantly, leverage them to benefit the audio event detection task. We present an improved detection pipeline in which a verification step is appended to augment a detection system. This step employs a high-quality event classifier to postprocess the benign event hypotheses outputted by the detection system and reject false alarms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, we implement and pair up different event detectors based on the most common detection schemes and various event classifiers, ranging from the standard bag-of-words model to the state-of-the-art bank-of-regressors one. Experimental results on the ITC-Irst dataset show significant improvements to detection performance. More importantly, these improvements are consistent for all detector-classifier combinations.},

From this discussion we propose a design strategy meant to capture the relevant time-frequency contexts for learning timbre, which permits using domain knowledge for designing architectures.

  abstract = {In Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) two major approaches have been followed. While one utilizes engineered features such as mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients (MFCCs), the other uses learned features that are the outcome of an optimization algorithm. I-vectors are the result of a modeling technique that usually takes engineered features as input. It has been shown that standard MFCCs extracted from monaural audio signals lead to i-vectors that exhibit poor performance, especially on indoor acoustic scenes. At the same time, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well known for their ability to learn features by optimizing their filters. They have been applied on ASC and have shown promising results. In this paper, we first propose a novel multi-channel i-vector extraction and scoring scheme for ASC, improving their performance on indoor and outdoor scenes. Second, we propose a CNN architecture that achieves promising ASC results. Further, we show that i-vectors and CNNs capture complementary information from acoustic scenes. Finally, we propose a hybrid system for ASC using multi-channel i-vectors and CNNs by utilizing a score fusion technique. Using our method, we participated in the ASC task of the DCASE-2016 challenge. Our hybrid approach achieved 1st rank among 49 submissions, substantially improving the previous state of the art.},

For the first algorithm, we make use of an ANN trained on different features extracted from the down-mixed mono channel audio. Secondly, we analyse a binaural algorithm where the same feature extraction is performed on four different channels: the two binaural channels, the averaged monaural signal and the difference between the binaural channels. The proposed feature set comprehends, along with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and log-mel energies, also activity information extracted with two different voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms. Moreover, we will present results obtained with two different neural architectures, namely multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks. The highest scores obtained on the DCASE 2016 evaluation dataset are achieved by a MLP trained on binaural features and adaptive energy VAD; they consist of an averaged error rate of 0.79 and an averaged F1 score of 48.1%, thus marking an improvement over the best score registered in the DCASE 2016 challenge.},
