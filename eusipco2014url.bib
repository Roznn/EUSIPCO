  abstract = {Orthonormal Basis Function (OBF) models provide a stable and well-conditioned representation of a linear system. When used for the modeling of room acoustics, useful information about the true dynamics of the system can be introduced by a proper selection of a set of poles, which however appear non-linearly in the model. A novel method for selecting the poles is proposed, which bypass the non-linear problem by exploiting the concept of sparsity and by using convex optimization. The model obtained has a longer impulse response compared to the all-zero model with the same number of parameters, without introducing substantial error in the early response. The method also allows to increase the resolution in a specified frequency region, while still being able to approximate the spectral envelope in other regions.},

  abstract = {The Lasso is an optimization problem devoted to finding a sparse representation of some signal with respect to a predefined dictionary. An original and computationally-efficient method is proposed here to solve this problem, based on a dynamic screening principle. It makes it possible to accelerate a large class of optimization algorithms by iteratively reducing the size of the dictionary during the optimization process, discarding elements that are provably known not to belong to the solution of the Lasso. The iterative reduction of the dictionary is what we call dynamic screening. As this screening step is inexpensive, the computational cost of the algorithm using our dynamic screening strategy is lower than that of the base algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data support the relevance of this approach.},

This task has been recently integrated in the joint detection estimation [1] resulting in the so-called joint parcellation detection estimation (JPDE) model [2]. JPDE automatically estimates the parcels from the fMRI data but requires the desired number of parcels to be fixed. This is potentially critical in that the chosen number of parcels may influence detection-estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a model selection procedure to automatically set the number of parcels from the data. The selection procedure relies on the calculation of the free energy corresponding to each concurrent model, within the variational expectation maximization framework. Experiments on synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedure to select the optimal number of parcels.},

We observe that most of the recording channels from different brain regions display seizure activity. We wonder if the brain behavior changes within a given seizure. Using source separation methods on temporal sliding windows, we develop a map of dynamic behavior to study this dynamicity. The map is built by computing the correlation functions between the main sources extracted in different time windows. The proposed method is applied on iEEG of four GAERS. We see that the behavior of brain changes about 0.5s - 1.5s after onset when the relevant temporal sources become very similar. The corresponding spatial maps for each time window shows that the seizure activity starts from a focus and propagates quickly.},

In a recent comparison of source imaging techniques, the VB-SCCD algorithm, which exploits the sparsity of the variational map of the sources, proved to be a promising approach. In this paper, we propose several ways to improve this method. In order to adjust the size of the estimated sources, we add a regularization term that imposes sparsity in the original source domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of ADMM, which permits to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, we also consider the exploitation of the temporal structure of the data by employing L1;2-norm regularization.

It is of interest in brain-computer interfaces where haemodynamic patterns in motor tasks are exploited to detect movement. However, the NIRS signal is usually corrupted with background biological processes, some of which are periodic or quasi-periodic in nature. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a time-series decomposition method which separates a signal into a trend, oscillatory components and noise with minimal prior assumptions about their nature. Due to the frequency spectrum overlap of the movement response and of background processes such as Mayer waves, spectral filters are usually suboptimal. In this study, we perform SSA both in an online and a block fashion resulting in the removal of periodic components and in increased classification performance. Our study indicates that SSA is a practical method that can replace spectral filtering and is evaluated on healthy participants and patients with tetraplegia.},

However, there has been little work that studies this topic in detail. In this paper, we first show that favorable propagation offers the most desirable scenario in terms of maximizing the sum-capacity. One useful proxy for whether propagation is favorable or not is the channel condition number. However, this proxy is not good for the case where the norms of the channel vectors are not equal. For this case, to evaluate how favorable the propagation offered by the channel is, we propose a “distance from favorable propagation” measure, which is the gap between the sum-capacity and the maximum capacity obtained under favorable propagation. Secondly, we examine how favorable the channels can be for two extreme scenarios: i.i.d. Rayleigh fading and uniform random line-of-sight (UR-LoS). Both environments offer (nearly) favorable propagation. Furthermore, to analyze the UR-LoS model, we propose an urns-and-balls model. This model is simple and explains the singular value spread characteristic of the UR-LoS model well.},

  abstract = {Because of their lower complexity and better error performance over K-best detectors, lattice-reduction (LR)-aided K-best detectors have recently proposed for large-scale multiinput multi-output (MIMO) detection. Among existing LR-aided K-best detectors, complex LR-aided K-best detector is more attractive compared to its real counterpart due to its potential lower latency and resources. However, one main difficulty in hardware implementation of complex LR-aided K-best is to efficiently find top K children of each layer in complex domain. In this paper, we propose and implement an LR-aided K-best algorithm that efficiently finds top K children in each layer when K is relatively small. Our implementation results on Xilinx VC707 FPGA board show that, with the aid of LR, the proposed LR-aided K-best implementation can support 3 Gbps transmissions for 16×16 MIMO systems with 1024-QAM with about 2.7 dB loss to the maximum likelihood detector at bit-error rate 10-4.},

Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, as well as of the environments in which they occur, it is rare that a single modality can provide complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities at once introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. It is the aim of this paper to evoke and promote various challenges in multimodal data fusion at the conceptual level, without focusing on any specific model, method or application.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is one of the most common ways to extract relevant information about the Earth through observations. Remote sensing acquisitions can be done by both active (SAR, LiDAR) and passive (optical and thermal range, multispectral and hyperspectral) devices. According to the sensor, diverse information of Earth's surface can be obtained. These devices provide information about the structure (optical, SAR), elevation (LiDAR) and material content (multiand hyperspectral). Together they can provide information about land use (urban, climatic changes), natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes), and potential exploitation (oil fields, minerals). In addition, images taken at different times can provide information about damages from floods, fires, seasonal changes etc. In this paper, we sketch the current opportunities and challenges related to the exploitation of multimodal data for Earth observation. This is done by leveraging the outcomes of the Data Fusion contests (organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society) which has been fostering the development of research and applications on this topic during the past decade.},

  abstract = {Joint analysis of data from multiple sources has proved useful in many disciplines including metabolomics and social network analysis. However, data fusion remains a challenging task in need of data mining tools that can capture the underlying structures from multi-relational and heterogeneous data sources. In order to address this challenge, data fusion has been formulated as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem. Coupled factorization problems have commonly been solved using alternating methods and, recently, unconstrained all-at-once optimization algorithms. In this paper, unlike previous studies, in order to have a flexible modeling framework, we use a general-purpose optimization solver that solves for all factor matrices simultaneously and is capable of handling additional linear/nonlinear constraints with a nonlinear objective function. We formulate CMTF as a constrained optimization problem and develop accurate models more robust to overfactoring. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling/algorithmic framework is demonstrated on simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {Smart rooms are used for a growing number of practical applications. They are often equipped with microphones and cameras allowing acoustic and visual tracking of persons. For that, the geometry of the sensors has to be calibrated. In this paper, a method is introduced that calibrates the microphone arrays by using the visual localization of a speaker at a small number of fixed positions. By matching the positions to the direction of arrival (DoA) estimates of the microphone arrays, their absolute position and orientation are derived. Data from a reverberant smart room is used to show that the proposed method can estimate the absolute geometry with about 0.1m and 2° precision. The calibration is good enough for acoustic and multi modal tracking applications and eliminates the need for dedicated calibration measures by using the tracking data itself.},

We first approximate the legitimate transmitter covariance matrix by employing Taylor series expansion, then this secrecy rate problem can be formulated into a Stackelberg game based on a fixed covariance matrix of the transmitter, where the transmitter and the jammer try to maximize their revenues. This secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated into a Stackelberg game where the jammer and the transmitter are the leader and follower of the game, respectively. For the proposed game, Stackelberg equilibrium is analytically derived.

  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are a recent technology where the nodes cooperate to obtain, in a totally distributed way, certain function of the collected data. An important example of these distributed processes is the average gossip algorithm, which allows the nodes to obtain the global average by only using local data exchanges. This process is traditionally slow, but can be accelerated by introducing geographic information or by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. However, when a gossip protocol utilizes long geographic routes or broadcast communications, its convergence is not easily guaranteed due to asymmetry in communications. Alternatively, we propose an asymmetric version of the gossip algorithm that exploits residual information involved in each asymmetric exchange. Our asymmetric gossip algorithm achieves convergence faster than existing studies in the related literature. Numerical results are presented to show clearly the validity and efficiency of our approach.},

Consequently, energy consumption has become a key criterion for the design of future mobile communication systems. Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been shown to improve the spectral efficiency and also reduce the power consumption of mobile communication networks. In this paper, we propose a two-tier deployment of D2D communication within a network to reduce the overall power consumption of the network and compared it with full small-cell deployment throughout the network. In this context, we computed the backhaul power consumption of each link in the networks and derived the backhaul energy efficiency expression of the networks. Simulation results show that our proposed network deployment outperforms the network with full small-cell deployment in terms of backhaul power consumption, backhaul energy-efficiency, total power consumption of the tier 2 users and downlink power consumption, thus providing a greener alternative to small-cell deployment.},

  abstract = {High mobility of terminals constitutes a hot topic that is commonly envisaged for the next Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communication systems. The wireless propagation channel is a time-frequency variant. This aspect can dramatically damage the waveforms orthogonality that is induced in the Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Consequently, this results in oppressive Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which leads to performance degradation in OFDM systems. To efficiently overcome these drawbacks, we developed in [1] an adequate algorithm that maximizes the received Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) by optimizing systematically the OFDM waveforms at the Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) sides. In this paper, we go further by investigating the performance evaluation of this algorithm. We start by testing its robustness against time and frequency synchronization errors. Then, as this algorithm banks on an iterative approach to find the optimal waveforms, we study the impact of the waveform initialization on its convergence. The obtained simulation results confirm the efficiency of this algorithm and its robustness compared to the conventional OFDM schemes, which makes it an appropriate good candidate for 5G systems.},

  abstract = {In the field of underlay cognitive radio communications, the signal transmitted by the secondary user is disturbed by incoming signals from primary users. Thus, it is necessary to compensate for this secondary-link degradation at the receiver level. In this paper we use Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM) to relax a priori assumptions on the characteristics of the primary user-induced interference. DPM allow us to model the probability density function of the interference. The latter is estimated jointly with the symbols and the channel of the secondary link by using marginalized particle filtering. Our approach makes it possible to improve the symbol error rate compared with an algorithm that simply models the interference as a Gaussian noise.},

In this method, predicted values in each block are generated in spatial domain like the conventional intra prediction methods. On the other hand, prediction residuals to be encoded are separately calculated in DCT domain, i.e. differences between the original and predicted values are calculated after performing DCT. Such a prediction framework allows us to change the coding process from block-wise order to coefficient-wise one. When the coefficient-wise order is adopted, a block to be predicted is almost always surrounded by partially reconstructed image signals, and therefore, efficient interpolative prediction can be performed.

The reference frame is interpolated and motion vectors are refined with fractional components to reduce the prediction error. Due to the high complexity of these steps, sub-pixel motion estimation can be very demanding in terms of encoding time and resources. A method to reduce complexity of motion estimation schemes is proposed in this paper based on adaptive precision. A parameter is computed to geometrically characterise each block and select whether fractional refinements are likely to improve coding efficiency or not. The selection is based on an estimate of the actual impact of fractional refinements on the coding performance. The method was implemented within the H.264/AVC standard and is shown achieving considerable time savings with respect to conventional schemes, while ensuring that the performance losses are kept below acceptable limits.},

Traditionally a matching metric such as mean square error distortion is adopted to select the best matches associated with disparities. However several disparities related to a given pixel may satisfy the distortion criterion although quite often the choice that is made does not necessarily meet the coding objective. An entropy-constrained disparity optimization approach is developed where the traditional matching metric is replaced by a joint entropy-distortion metric so that the selected disparities reduce not only the reconstructed image distortion but also the entropy disparity. The algorithm sequentially builds a tree avoiding a full search and ensuring good rate-distortion performance. At each tree depth, the M-best retained paths are extended to build new paths to which are assigned entropy-distortion metrics. Simulations show that our algorithm provides better results than dynamic programming algorithm.},

  abstract = {Spectral activity detection of wideband radio-frequency (RF) signals for cognitive radios typically requires expensive and energy-inefficient analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Fortunately, the RF spectrum is-in many practical situations-sparsely populated, which enables the design of so called analog-to-information (A2I) converters. A2I converters are capable of acquiring and extracting the spectral activity information at low cost and low power by means of compressive sensing (CS). In this paper, we present a high-throughput spectrum recovery stage for CS-based wideband A2I converters. The recovery stage is designed for a CS-based signal acquisition front-end that performs pseudo-random subsampling in combination with coarse quantization. High-throughput spectrum activity detection from such coarsely quantized and compressive measurements is achieved by means of a massively-parallel VLSI design of a novel accelerated sparse signal dequantization (ASSD) algorithm. The resulting design is implemented in 28 nm SOI CMOS and able to reconstruct 215-point frequency-sparse RF spectra at a rate of more than 7.6 k reconstructions/second.},

  abstract = {In this work, an FFT architecture supporting variable FFT sizes, 128~2048/1536, is proposed. This implementation is a combination of a 2p point Common Factor FFT and a 3 point DFT. Various FFT output pruning techniques for this architecture are discussed in terms of memory and control logic overhead. It is shown that the used Prime Factor FFT as an FFT in the 1536 point FFT is able to increase throughput by exploiting single tone pruning with low control logic overhead. The proposed FFT processor is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA. It occupies only 3148 LUTs and 612 kb memory in FGPA and calculates 1536 point FFT less than 3092 clock cycles with output pruned settings.},

  abstract = {The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard provides a large improvement in terms of compression efficiency in comparison to its predecessors, mainly due to the introduction of new coding tools and more flexible data structures. However, since much more options are tested in a Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimization scheme, such improvement is accompanied by a significant increase in the encoding computational complexity. We propose in this paper a novel method for efficient early-splitting decision of inter-predicted Coding Blocks (CB). The method employs a set of decision trees which are trained using information from unconstrained HEVC encoding runs. The resulting early-splitting decision process has an accuracy of 86% with a negligible computational overhead and an average computational complexity decrease of 42% at the cost of a very small Bjontegaard Delta (BD)-rate increase (0.3%).},

  abstract = {The high level of compression efficiency achieved by HEVC coding techniques decreases the error resilience performance under error prone conditions. This paper addresses the error resiliency of the HEVC standard, focusing on the new motion estimation tools. It is shown that the temporal dependency of motion information is comparatively higher than that in the H.264/AVC standard, causing an increase in the error propagation. Based on this evidence, this paper proposes a method to make intelligent use of temporal motion vector (MV) candidates during the motion estimation process, in order to decrease the temporal dependency, and improve the error resiliency without penalising the rate-distortion performance. The simulation results show that the proposed method improves the error resilience under tested conditions by increasing the video quality by up to 1.7 dB in average, compared to the reference method that always enables temporal MV candidates.},

In a multiview scenario, the correlation between views can also be exploited to further enhance the overall Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. Thus, to generate SI in a multiview distributed coding scenario, a joint disparity and motion estimation technique is proposed, based on optical flow.

The source is assumed to be spatially sparse meaning it can be modeled as a point source. The finite difference time domain method is used to model the acoustics of a simple two dimensional square room and its matrix formulation is presented. A two step method is proposed. First a convex optimization problem is solved to localize the source while exploiting its spatial sparsity.

We evaluate these cost terms on different mixtures of samples of pitched instruments, drum sounds and other acoustical signals. Our results show, that penalizing large spectral variations can improve separation quality.

In the case where a hearing aid user is fitted with a binaural hearing aid, it is important that the binaural cues are kept intact, such that the user does not loose spatial awareness, the ability to localize sounds, or the benefits of spatial unmasking. Typically algorithms focus on rendering the source of interest in the correct spatial location, but degrade all other source positions in the auditory scene. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses a binary mask such that the target signal is enhanced but the background noise remains unmodified except for an attenuation. We also present two variations of the algorithm, and in initial evaluations find that this type of mask-based processing has promising performance.},

The analytical bound is shown to be applicable to correlated and uncorrelated channels, as well as to small and large scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The results demonstrate that GSM is more suitable for large-scale MIMO systems than SM. The performance gain of GSM over SM is about 5 dB. The results also show that SM is very robust to CSEs. Specifically, the performance degradation of SM in the presence of CSEs are 0.7 dB and 0.3 dB for Rayleigh and Rician fading channels respectively.

  abstract = {In this paper we describe two interactive applications for capturing the motion signatures associated with key skills of traditional sports and games. We first present the case for sport as an important example of intangible cultural heritage. We then explain that sport requires special consideration in terms of digitization for preservation as the key aspects to be digitized are the characteristic movement signatures of such sports. We explain that, given the nature of traditional sporting agencies, this requires low-cost motion capture technology. Furthermore we argue that in order to ensure ongoing preservation, this should be provided via fun interactive gaming scenarios that promote uptake of the sports, particularly among children. We then present two such games that we have developed and illustrate their performance.},

The video and image legacy content can include camera motion, several players, considerable partial occlusions, motion blur and image noise, recorded with non-calibrated cameras, which increases even more the difficulty of solving the problem of 3D reconstruction from 2D data. Therefore, we propose a semi-automatic approach in which a set of 2D key-points are manually marked in key-frames and then an automatic process estimates the camera calibration parameters, the positions and poses of the players and their body part dimensions. In-between frames are automatically estimated taking into account constraints related to human kinematics and collisions with the environment. Experimental results show that this approach obtains reconstructions that can help to analyze playing techniques and the evolution of sports through time.},

The NRLM algorithm with p-modulus and q-norm makes adaptive filters fast convergent and robust against two types of impulse noise: one is found in observation noise and another at filter input. We develop theoretical analysis of the algorithm for calculating filter convergence. Through experiment with simulations and theoretical calculations, effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. We also find that the filter convergence does not critically depend on the value of p or q, allowing use of p = q = infinity that makes it easiest to calculate the p-modulus and q-norm. The theoretical convergence is in good agreement with the simulation results which validates the analysis.},

The new structure provides the characterization of the nodes by the information, which they provide to and they request from the network. Its features are explained and its implementation and visualization are also detailed. We also design two clustering methods with different strategies respectively, which provide the analysis from different points of view. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a simplified example. By comparing the graph layout with the conventional directed graph, the new dual-layer representation reveals deeper insight into the complex networks and provides more opportunities for versatile clustering analysis.},

Once designed, the quantizer codebook is fixed over time and does not take advantage of possible correlations in the input signals. Exploiting correlation in scalar quantization could be achieved by predictive quantization, however, for the price of a higher bit error sensitivity. In order to improve the Lloyd-Max quantizer performance for correlated processes without encoder-sided prediction, a novel scalar decoding approach utilizing the correlation of input signals is proposed in this paper. Based on previously received samples, the current sample can be predicted a priori. Thereafter, a quantization codebook adapted over time will be generated according to the prediction error probability density function. Compared to the standard LMQ, distinct improvement is achieved with our receiver in error-free and error-prone transmission conditions, both with hard-decision and soft-decision decoding.},

To this aim, the received signal is differentially auto-correlated and compensated with a frequency offset whose value depends on the used Zadoff-Chu sequence. The same metric allows detecting both the symbol timing and the sector identifier.

An optimal averaging horizon of Nopt points required by the EFIR filter can be determined via measurements with much smaller efforts and cost than for the noise statistics. These properties of EFIR filtering are distinctive advantages against the extended Kalman filter (EKF). A payment for this is an Nopt - 1 times longer operation which, however, can be reduced to that of the EKF by using parallel computing.

  abstract = {Most of the available frequency estimation methods are restricted for the application to signals without a bias or a carrier signal. For offline analysis of a signal an existing carrier may be determined and eliminated. However, in the case of online computations the carrier is not accurately known a priori in general. An error in the carrier signal directly affects the accuracy of the subsequent instantaneous frequency estimation approach. This article focusses on the online instantaneous frequency estimation of non-stationary signals based on the empirical mode decomposition scheme. Especially Hermite spline interpolation of samples for empirical mode decomposition is addressed. Hermite splines enables the definition of enhanced boundary conditions and leads to an effective online instantaneous frequency estimation approach. Throughout the article algorithmic details are examined by a theoretical example.},

In this paper, we focus our attention on the case of an additive colored measurement noise modeled by a moving average process. More particularly, we propose to estimate the TVAR parameters by using a variant of the improved least-squares (ILS) methods, initially introduced by Zheng to estimate the AR parameters from a signal embedded in a white noise.

We show that the ℓ0-norm works as a contrast function, if the length of the impulse response of the system is smaller than the shortest distance between two spikes of the input signal. Demonstrating this sufficient condition is our basic theoretical result. However, one of the problems of dealing with the ℓ0-norm in optimization problems is the requirement of exhaustive or combinatorial search methods, since it is a non continuous function. In order to propose an alternative for that, Mohimani et al. (2009) proposed a smoothed and continuous version of the ℓ0-norm. Here, we propose a modification of this criterion in order to make it scale-invariant and, finally, we derive a gradient-based algorithm for the modified criterion. Results with synthetic data suggests that the imposed conditions are sufficient but not strictly necessary.},

  abstract = {In visual sensor networks, local feature descriptors can be computed at the sensing nodes, which work collaboratively on the data obtained to make an efficient visual analysis. In fact, with a minimal amount of computational effort, the detection and extraction of local features, such as binary descriptors, can provide a reliable and compact image representation. In this paper, it is proposed to extract and code binary descriptors to meet the energy and bandwidth constraints at each sensing node. The major contribution is a binary descriptor coding technique that exploits the correlation using two different coding modes: Intra, which exploits the correlation between the elements that compose a descriptor; and Inter, which exploits the correlation between descriptors of the same image. The experimental results show bitrate savings up to 35% without any impact in the performance efficiency of the image retrieval task.},

  abstract = {The separable wavelet transform has limited directional sensitivity and is suboptimal for compression of textured images. A finer directional resolution and better coding results can be achieved by contourlet transform. So far, directional filters based on design criteria that are unspecific to image compression were used for contourlet transform. We propose directional filters that are optimized specifically for image coding. Thereto, a filter design method that is based on maximization of coding gain was developed. Directional filters were designed for all images of two standard test image databases and compared experimentally to standard filters. In most cases the newly designed filters performed better than standard filters.},

  abstract = {Cognitive radio is a promising technique for efficient spectrum utilization in wireless systems. In multi-user Multiple- Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system, a large amount of feedback information has to be used to achieve multi-user diversity. In this paper, in order to reduce the feedback amount and hence the wasted energy, we propose a novel scheduling scheme of secondary users (SUs) for an underlay cognitive radio network. Our scheme is based on opportunistic beamforming and employs multiple feedback thresholds. The lowest threshold is chosen to insure a predefined allowed scheduling outage probability. A scheduling outage event occurs if at least one transmit beam has no feedback information. The other thresholds are chosen in order to reduce the number of SUs feeding back their maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) (and hence the wasted energy) and the delay due to the number of attempts. We show via simulations that a significant gain in terms of energy is obtained at the price of a reasonable delay.},

In this context, we present novel sparse AIC designs based on a zero-norm minimization of the matrix defining the cancellation weights. These designs drastically reduce the number of operations per symbol, and thus the power consumption, while allowing to tune the loss with respect the optimal design.

Particularly challenging problem in this context is spurious intermodulation (IM) components due to nonlinear power amplifier (PA), which may easily overlap the receiver band. With realistic duplex filters, the residual spurious IM at RX band can be several dBs stronger than the thermal noise floor, leading to own receiver desensitization. In this paper, we carry out detailed signal modeling of spurious emissions due to wideband PAs at the third-order IM band. Stemming from this modeling, and using the known transmit data, we present an efficient nonlinear digital identification and cancellation technique to suppress the unwanted IM components at RX band. The proposed technique is verified with computer simulations, showing excellent calibration properties, hence relaxing filtering and duplexing distance requirements in spectrally-agile CA transceivers.},

By emitting extremely-narrow impulses in time domain, these systems can achieve a great range resolution. However, one drawback is their difficulty to control their narrow waveform. On the other hand, because of its many advantages, the chirped waveform has been extensively used in radars and has become the standard employed signal. Here, for the first time, the chirped waveform is exploited in SDR-inspired IR-UWB radars, thus bringing together the benefits of both worlds. The key element in this radar architecture is a passive device shaped by smoothly-chirped coupled lines (SCCL) to produce the chirped signal.

First, an angular spectrum-based method is applied to count and locate the sources. A nonlinear GCC-PHAT metric is exploited for this purpose. The estimated channel coefficients are then utilized to obtain a primary estimate of the source spectrograms through binary masking. Afterwards, the individual spectrograms are decomposed using a Bayesian NMF approach. This way, the number of components required for modeling each source is inferred based on data. These factors are then utilized as initial values for the EM algorithm which maximizes the joint likelihood of the 2-channel data to extract the individual source signals. It is shown that this initialization scheme can greatly improve the performance of the source separation over random initialization. The experiments are performed on synthetic mixtures of speech and music signals.},

In this paper, we put forward a trick to help the corresponding parameter estimation algorithm to converge toward more meaningful solutions, based on the new concept of brakes. The idea is to control the convergence rate of the parameters of a PLCA-based model within the estimation algorithm: the parameters which are known to be properly initialized are braked in order to stay close to their initial values, whereas the other ones keep a regular convergence rate. This is an effective way to better account for a relevant initialization. In this paper, these brakes are implemented in the framework of PLCA, and they are tested in an application of multipitch estimation. Results show that the use of brakes can significantly influence the decomposition and thus the performance, making them a powerful tool to boost any kind of PLCA-based algorithm.},

  abstract = {We introduce in this paper a concept of using acoustic superframes, a mid-level representation which can overcome the drawbacks of both global and simple frame-level representations for acoustic events. Through superframe-level recognition, we explore the phenomenon of superframe co-occurrence across different event categories and propose an efficient classification scheme that takes advantage of this feature sharing to improve the event-wise recognition power. We empirically show that our recognition system results in 2.7% classification error rate on the ITC-Irst database. This state-of-the-art performance demonstrates the efficiency of this proposed approach. Furthermore, we argue that this presentation can pretty much facilitate the event detection task compared to its counterparts, e.g. global and simple frame-level representations.},

A bounded symmetrical approximation of the logarithm is employed to estimate the interaural level difference, resulting in identical values for symmetrical (left/right) frontal angles. It proposes a new cost function to be used in association with the multichannel Wiener filter technique to provide a trade-off between noise reduction and distortion of the localization cues. Simulations of a binaural setup and comparisons with a previously developed technique show that the new method gives a signal to noise ratio improvement of up to 9.6 dB better than the baseline technique, for the same maximum-tolerated binaural-cue distortion.},

  pages = {641-645},
  abstract = {Active cancellation systems rely on destructive interference to achieve rejection of unwanted disturbances entering the system of interest. Typical practical applications of this method employ a simple single input, single output arrangement. However, when a spatial wavefield (e.g. acoustic noise or vibration) needs to be controlled, multichannel active cancellation systems arise naturally. Among these, the so-called overdetermined control configuration, which employs more measurement outputs than control inputs, is often found to provide superior performance. The paper proposes an extension of the recently introduced control scheme, called self-optimizing narrowband interference canceller (SONIC), to the overdetermined case. The extension employs a novel variant of the extremum-seeking adaptation loop which uses random, rather than sinusoidal, probing signals. This modification simplifies design of the controller and improves its convergence. Simulations, performed using a realistic model of the plant, demonstrate improved properties of the new controller.},

  abstract = {Psychoacoustic studies show that the strength of masking is, among others, dependent on the tonality of the masker: the effect of noise maskers is stronger than that of tone maskers. Recently, a Partial Spectral Flatness Measure (PSFM) was introduced for tonality estimation in a psychoacoustic model for perceptual audio coding. The model consists of an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filterbank which considers the spreading effect of individual local maskers in simultaneous masking. An optimized (with respect to audio quality and computational efficiency) PSFM is now compared to a similar psychoacoustic model with prediction based tonality estimation in medium (48 kbit/s) and low (32 kbit/s) bit rate conditions (mono) via subjective quality tests. 15 expert listeners participated in the subjective tests. The results are depicted and discussed. Additionally, we conducted the subjective tests with 15 non-expert consumers whose results are also shown and compared to those of the experts.},

Speech utterances are represented by Gaussian mixture model mean supervectors, and also the projection of the supervectors into a low-dimensional discriminative subspace by linear discriminant analysis is assessed. This technique shows robustness to segmentation errors and, compared with the widely used Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based stopping criterion, results in a lower speaker clustering error and dramatically reduces computation time.

However, it may magnify noise that causes a lower output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the MVDR beamformer. Contrarily, the MVDR beamformer suffers from interference in output. In this paper, we propose a controllable LCMV (C-LCMV) beamformer based on the principles of both the MVDR and LCMV beamformers. The C-LCMV approach can control a compromise between noise reduction and interference rejection. Simulation results show that the C-LCMV beamformer outperforms the MVDR beamformer in interference rejection, and the LCMV beamformer in background noise reduction.},

We propose a new methodology to estimate this change and to exploit it for velocity estimation using acoustic signals. In this way, the amplitude based velocity estimation techniques can be substituted by non-stationary time - frequency signal processing. This technique proves to be more robust in terms of interferences and can provide a more detailed representation of any turbulent environment.},

Further improvements are a cepstral lifter to increase the method's performance by removing nonrelevant cepstral coefficients and a polynomial of second order to map the results onto final estimates. Results indicate larger deviations in the estimated decay times of late reverberations, while estimates for the early decay times are within the just noticable difference (JND) and deviate only slightly from the true values.

  abstract = {This paper proposes an impact noise suppression method in zero phase (ZP) domain. The signal in ZP domain (ZP signal) is obtained by taking IDFT of the pth power of a spectral amplitude. We previously proposed an impact noise suppressor in ZP domain for reducing impact noise signals, even if they are accompanied with damped oscillation. Unfortunately, the previous method causes speech degradation in non-impact noise segments, because this method performs noise reduction in all the segments. Since an impact noise exists only a short duration, we restrict the noise suppression procedure so that it cannot be applied to the non-impact noise segments. The restriction is achieved by using the ratio of the first to the second peak values of the ZP signal. In non-impact noise segments, this ratio becomes much larger than one. Thus, we can improve speech quality of the extracted signal when the restriction works well. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves about 15dB of SNR for a speech signal mixed with clap noise with SNR= 0dB.},

  abstract = {Compressive sensing exploits the structure of signals to acquire them with fewer measurements than required by the Nyquist-Shannon theory. However, the design of practical compressive sensing hardware raises several issues. First, one has to elicit a measurement mechanism that exhibits adequate incoherence properties. Second, the system should be robust to noise, whether it be measurement noise, or calibration noise, i.e. discrepancies between theoretical and actual measurement matrices. Third, to improve performance in the case of strong noise, it is not clear whether one should increase the number of sensors, or rather take several measurements, thus settling in the multiple measurement vector scenario (MMV). Here, we first show how measurement matrices may be estimated by calibration instead of being assumed perfectly known, and second that if the noise level reaches a few percents of the signal level, MMV is the only way to sample sparse signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.},

The concept involves an infrastructure of stationary and independent senders tracking mobile receivers. The main goal is pure line-of-sight (LOS) communication for correct localization. When ignoring the reception energy of multipaths the transmission range is reduced to 20 meters and we need more devices to cover the same area (0.03 devices/m2). Thus, for cost-effectiveness and easy installation, we focus in the sender design on low power consumption for long battery or even energy independent operation. Moreover, we use the energy efficient π=4-DQPSK modulation technique to send 8 data bits in 3.5 ms. An identifier in each message along with the reception time can be used for TDOA localization. The frame synchronization error for a distance of 20m at 3 dB SNR is 11.2 ns. Thus, for speed of sound the distance measurement error is 3.7 μm.},

Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) is a known method to sample sparse multiband signals below the Nyquist rate and the precision recovery relies on high precision quantization of samples which may take a great bit-budget. This paper proposes an alternative system that optimizes space utilization by applying comparator in sub-Nyquist sampling system. The system first multiplies the signal by a bank of periodic waveforms, and then it performs lowpass filtering, sampling and quantization through the comparator which just keeps the sign information. And we introduce a corresponding algorithm for perfect recovery. The primary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low bit-budget. We compare our system with MWC to prove its advantages in condition of fixed bit-budget, particularly in low levels of input signal to noise ratio.},

This allows their truncation in time with controllable error, and results in a reduction of computational complexity of reconstruction process to O(N L2). where N is number of samples, and L ≈ τ.

  abstract = {Distributed Compressive Sensing (DCS) theory effectively reduces the number of measurements of each signal, by exploiting both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures, which saves on the costs of sampling devices as well as of communication and data processing. In many fields, only the mixtures of source signals are available for compressive sampling, without prior information on both the source signals and the mixing process. However, people are still interested in the source signal rather than the mixing signals. There is a basic solution which reconstructs the mixing signals from the compressive measurements first and then separates the source signals by estimating mixing matrix. However, the reconstruction process takes considerable time and also introduces error into the estimation step. A novel method is proposed in this paper, which directly separates the mixing compressive measurements by estimating the mixing matrix first and then reconstruct the interesting source signals. At the same time, in most situations, the source signals are analog signals. In this paper, Random Demodulation (RD) system is introduced to compressively sample the analog signal. We also verify the independence and non-Gaussian property of the compressive measurement. The experimental results proves that the proposed method is feasible and compared to the basic method, the estimation accuracy is improved.},

Among sparse representations, the cosparse analysis model has recently gained increasing interest. Many signals exhibit a multidimensional structure, e.g. images or three-dimensional MRI scans. Most data analysis and learning algorithms use vectorized signals and thereby do not account for this underlying structure. The drawback of not taking the inherent structure into account is a dramatic increase in computational cost. We propose an algorithm for learning a cosparse Analysis Operator that adheres to the preexisting structure of the data, and thus allows for a very efficient implementation. This is achieved by enforcing a separable structure on the learned operator. Our learning algorithm is able to deal with multidimensional data of arbitrary order. We evaluate our method on volumetric data at the example of three-dimensional MRI scans.},

It is possible to solve this game by considering accurate computations of the type I and type II probability errors and by using additive stochastic processes to model the print and scan channel. Considering the print and scan models as Lognormal or Generalized gaussian additive processes, we maximize the authentication performances for two different security scenarios. The first one considers the opponent as passive and assumes that his print-and-scan channel is the same as the legitimate channel. The second scenario devises a minimax game where an active opponent tries to maximize the probability of non-detection by choosing appropriate parameters on his channel. Our first conclusions are the facts that (i) the authentication performance is better for dense noises than for sparse noises for both scenarios, and (ii) for both families of distribution, the opponent optimal parameters are close to the legitimate source parameters, and (iii) the legitimate source can find a configuration which maximizes the authentication performance.},

An in-depth analysis of the optimal settings for HOG for onboard vehicle verification is presented, in the context of SVM classification with different kernels. In contrast to many existing approaches, the evaluation is realized in a public and heterogeneous database of vehicle and non-vehicle images in different areas of the road, rendering excellent verification rates that outperform other similar approaches in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper concentrates on the estimation of linear and circular blurred contours in an image. To solve this problem, we start from recently investigated signal models, derived through the association of an array of virtual sensors and the image. The array is linear when linear blurred contours are expected, and circular when circular blurred contours are expected. For the first time in this paper, we propose a common array processing model for both types of contours, which makes their retrieval closer to each other. We propose a common criterion to minimize for the estimation of the contour parameters, and justify the usage of particle swarm optimization for its minimization. An application to fire characterization exemplifies our method.},

As a particular case study, the use of discrete cosine transform Type-II even (DCT2e) is analyzed. In this case, a simple structure that recover the transmitted symbol at the receiver is also shown.

The transmitter has no instantaneous channel state information (CSI) but can receive an outdated version of CSI from both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper through reliable multi-bit feedback channels. Using outdated CSI, the transmitter can adapt the coding rates. Since the transmitter cannot adapt the coding rates to the instantaneous channel conditions, we consider the outage performance of secure HARQ protocols. We show how to find the optimal rate-adaptation policies to maximize the secrecy throughput under constraints on outage probabilities. Numerical results for a Rayleigh-fading WTC show that the rate-adaptation using multilevel feedbacks provides important gains in secrecy throughput comparing to the non-adaptive model. The fact that the eavesdropper also feedbacks information may seem unrealistic, but obtained results can be understood as an upper limit of the possible secrecy throughput improvements.},

These descriptions are then layered Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coded using low-density parity-check accumulate (LDPCA) -based syndrome binning. The decoder consists of two side decoders which attempt to iteratively decode their respective description at various LDPCA puncturing rates in the presence of a correlated side information. A central decoder exploits the inter-description correlation to further enhance the WZ rate-distortion performance when both descriptions are partially or fully received. In contrast to earlier work, our proposed decoding scheme also exploits the correlation that exists between bit-planes. Experimental simulations reveal that, for a Gaussian source, the proposed system yields a performance improvement of roughly 0.66 dB when compared to not exploiting inter-description correlations.},

Conforming to a given inter-agent communication topology, a distributed recursive estimator of the consensus-plus-innovations type is presented in which at every observation sampling epoch the network agents exchange a single round of messages with their communication neighbors and recursively update their local parameter estimates by simultaneously processing the received neighborhood data and the new information (innovation) embedded in the observation sample. Under global observability of the networked sensing model and mean connectivity of the inter-agent communication network, the proposed estimator is shown to yield consistent parameter estimates at each network agent. Furthermore, it is shown that the distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient, in that, the asymptotic covariances of the agent estimates coincide with that of the optimal centralized estimator, i.e., the inverse of the centralized Fisher information rate.},

Upon observing X0, the problem is to estimate the corresponding response variable Y0 by using the knowledge contained in a training set {(Xi, Yi)}in=1, made of n independent copies of (X0, Y0). In the distributed version of the problem, a network made of spatially distributed sensors and a common fusion center (FC) is considered. As X0 is made available at the FC, it is broadcast to all the sensors. Relying upon the locally available pair (Xi, Yi) and upon X0, sensor i sends a message containing Yi to the FC, or stays silent: only the few most informative response variables {Yi} should be sent, but no inter-sensor coordination is allowed. The analysis is asymptotic in the limit of large network size n and we show that, by means of a suitable ordered transmission policy, only a vanishing fraction of NN messages can be selected, yet preserving the consistency of the estimation even under communication constraints.},

However, the number of deployed sensors is often limited by several constraints, such as their cost. Therefore, their locations must be opportunely optimized to enhance the estimation of the parameters. In a previous work, we considered a low-dimensional linear model for the measured data and proposed a near-optimal algorithm to optimize the sensor placement. In this paper, we propose to model the data as a union of subspaces to further reduce the amount of sensors without degrading the quality of the estimation. Moreover, we introduce a greedy algorithm for the sensor placement for such a model and show the near-optimality of its solution. Finally, we verify with numerical experiments the advantage of the proposed model in reducing the number of sensors while maintaining intact the estimation performance.},

For such wireless sensor network applications, knowledge of node location is important. Although a uniform sensor distribution is common in the literature, it is normally difficult to achieve in reality. Thus we propose a robust algorithm for reconstructing two-dimensional diffusion fields, sampled with a network of arbitrarily placed sensors. The two-step method proposed here is based on source parameter estimation: in the first step, by properly combining the field sensed through well-chosen test functions, we show how Prony's method can reveal locations and intensities of the sources inducing the field. The second step then uses a modification of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to estimate the activation time in the single source field. We combine these steps to give a multi-source field estimation algorithm and carry out extensive numerical simulations to evaluate its performance.},

  abstract = {Maximising loudness of audio signals by restricting their dynamic range has become an important issue in audio signal processing. Previous works indicate that an allpass filter chain can reduce the peak amplitude of an audio signal, without introducing the distortion associated with traditional non-linear techniques. Because of large search space and the consequential demand of the computational needs, the previous work selected randomly the delay-line lengths and fixed the filter coefficient values. In this work, we run on a GPU accelerator multiple allpass filter chains in parallel that cover all relevant delay-line lengths and perform a wide search on possible coefficient values in order to get closer to the optimal choice. Our most exhaustive method, which tests about 29 million parameter combinations, reduced the amplitude of test signals by 23% to 31%, whereas the previous work could only achieve a reduction of 23% at best.},

  year = {2014},
  pages = {895-899},
  abstract = {Localization of audio sources using microphone arrays has been an important research problem for more than two decades. Many traditional methods for solving the problem are based on a two-stage procedure: first, information about the audio source, such as time differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) and gain ratios-of-arrival (GROAs) between microphones is estimated, and, second, this knowledge is used to localize the audio source. These methods often have a low computational complexity, but this comes at the cost of a limited estimation accuracy. Therefore, we propose a new localization approach, where the desired signal is modeled using TDOAs and GROAs, which are determined by the source location. This facilitates the derivation of one-stage, maximum likelihood methods under a white Gaussian noise assumption that is applicable in both near- and far-field scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed method is statistically efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art estimators in most scenarios, involving both synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {For decades, it has been investigated how to separately solve the problems of both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and pitch estimation. Recently, it was found that estimating these parameters jointly from multichannel recordings of audio can be extremely beneficial. Many joint estimators are based on knowledge of the inverse sample covariance matrix. Typically, this covariance is estimated using the sample covariance matrix, but for this estimate to be full rank, many temporal samples are needed. In cases with non-stationary signals, this is a serious limitation. We therefore investigate how a recent joint DOA and pitch filtering-based estimator can be combined with the iterative adaptive approach to circumvent this limitation in joint DOA and pitch estimation of audio sources. Simulations show a clear improvement compared to when using the sample covariance matrix and the considered approach also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the applicability of the considered approach is verified on real speech.},

We try to define sound objects and demonstrate by our experiments the existence of these objects.

The major reason for proposing the idea of sound objects is to work with a generic sound concept instead of working with a small set of acoustic events for detection as is the norm. Our definition tries to conform to notions present in human auditory perception. Our experimental results are promising, and show that the idea of sound objects is worth pursuing and that it could give a new direction to semi-supervised or unsupervised learning of acoustic event detection mechanisms.},

In this paper an improved patchwork-based audio watermarking algorithm in Constant-Q Transform (CQT) domain has been proposed. The advantage of CQT in music analysis lies in its nonlinear frequency spacing. However the absence of exact invertible transform still prevents CQT from the wide application. In this paper it is overcome by frame pair selection, which is carefully performed according to frame pair energy ratios of the middle frequency range to avoid the disturbance of watermarking embedding and degradation in signal quality afterwards. Watermarks are then embedded by modifying the energy of selected frame pairs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the latest patchwork-based audio watermarking algorithm in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain with better signal quality of embedded signals and yet more robust to the conventional attacks.},

An efficient, geometry-based approach that estimates the number of active interferers and their locations online is proposed.

The mismatched conditions may occur due to additive noise, different channel, and acoustic reverberation. In the conventional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction framework, a subband spectrum enhancement technique is incorporated to improve its robustness. We denote this front-end as robust MFCCs (RMFCC). Based on the gammatone and compressive gammachirp filter-banks, robust gammatone filterbank cepstral coefficients (RGFCC) and robust compressive gammachirp filterbank cepstral coefficients (RCGCC) are also presented for comparison. We also employ low-variance spectrum estimators such as multitaper, regularized minimum- variance distortionless response (RMVDR), instead of a discrete Fourier transform-based direct spectrum estimator for improving robustness against mismatched environments. Speech recognition performances of the robust feature extractors are evaluated in clean as well as multi-style training conditions of the AURORA-4 continuous speech recognition task. Experimental results depict that the RMFCC and low-variance spectrum-estimators-based robust feature extractors outperformed the MFCC, PNCC (power normalized cepstral coefficients), and ETSI-AFE features both in clean and multi-condition training conditions.},

If the topic of a document in known, recognizing the spoken words and indexing them to an intermediate representation is an easier task and consequently, detecting a search word in it will be more accurate and robust. In this paper, we propose the use of TDLMs in the indexing stage to improve the accuracy of STD in situations where the topic of the audio document is known in advance.

  abstract = {Sampling a finite stream of filtered pulses violates the bandlimited assumption of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory. However, recent low rate sampling schemes have shown that these sparse signals can be sampled with perfect reconstruction at their rate of innovation. To reach this goal in the presence of noise, an estimation procedure is needed to estimate the time-delay and the amplitudes of each pulse. To assess the quality of any unbiased estimator, it is standard to use the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) which provides a lower bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of any unbiased estimator. In this work, analytic expressions of the Cramér-Rao Bound are proposed for an arbitrary number of filtered pulses. Using orthogonality properties on the filtering kernels, an approximate compact expression of the CRB is provided. The choice of the kernel is discussed from the point of view of the estimation accuracy.},

Theoretical modelling and practical applications often make a white noise assumption when dealing with RSS measurements.

Owing to the small number of observations, the estimation of the covariance matrices is a severely ill-posed problem. This can be overcome by exploiting prior information about the structure of the covariance matrix. This paper presents a class of convex formulations and respective solutions to the high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation problem under compressive measurements, imposing either Toeplitz, sparseness, null-pattern, low rank, or low permuted rank structure on the solution, in addition to positive semi-definiteness. To solve the optimization problems, we introduce the Co-Variance by Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (CoVALSA), which is an instance of the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA). We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this paper we use modern sampling theory to propose a new robust registration algorithm that works with arbitrary sampling kernels. The algorithm accurately approximates continuous-time Fourier coefficients from discrete-time samples. These Fourier coefficients can be used to construct an over-complete system, which can be solved to approximate translational motion at around 100-th of a pixel accuracy. The over-completeness of the system provides robustness to noise and other modelling errors. For example we show an image registration result for images that have slightly different backgrounds, due to a viewpoint translation. Our previous registration techniques, based on similar sampling theory, can provide a similar accuracy but not under these more general conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the approach and demonstrate the potential applications in image super-resolution.},

  abstract = {In video images, apparent motions can be computed using optical flow estimation. However, estimation of the depth directional velocity is difficult using only a single viewpoint. Scene flows (SF) are three-dimensional (3D) vector fields with apparent motion and a depth directional velocity field, which are computed from stereo video. The 3D motion of objects and a camera can be estimated using SF, thus it is used for obstacle detection and self-localization. SF estimation methods require the numerical computation of nonlinear equations to prevent over-smoothing due to the regularization of SF. Since the numerical stability depends on the image and regularizer weights, it is impossible to determine appropriate values for the weights. Thus, we propose a method that is independent of the images and weights, which simplifies previous methods and derives the numerical stability conditions, thereby facilitating the estimation of suitable weights. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed method.},

Currently, most applications employ batch-form PLS methods, which require maintaining previous training data and re-training the model when new observations are available. In this work, we propose a novel approach that is able to update the PLS model in an online fashion. The proposed approach has the appealing property of constant computational complexity and const space complexity. Two extensions are proposed as well. First, we extend the method to be able to update the model when some training samples are removed. Second, we develop a weighted version, where different weights can be assigned to the data blocks when updating the model. Experiments on real image data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method for video-based smoke detection, which aims to discriminate smoke from smoke-colored moving objects by applying spatio-temporal analysis, smoke motion modeling and dynamic texture recognition. Initially, candidate smoke regions in a frame are identified using background subtraction and color analysis based on the HSV model. Subsequently, spatio-temporal smoke modeling consisting of spatial energy analysis and spatio-temporal energy analysis is applied in the candidate regions. In addition, histograms of oriented gradients and optical flows (HOGHOFs) are computed to take into account both appearance and motion information, while dynamic texture recognition is applied in each candidate region using linear dynamical systems and a bag of systems approach. Dynamic score combination by mean value is finally used to determine whether there is smoke or not in each candidate image region. Experimental results presented in the paper show the great potential of the proposed approach.},

The Delay/Doppler technique aims at reducing the measurement noise and increasing the along-track resolution in comparison with conventional pulse limited altimetry. A new semi-analytical model with five parameters has been recently introduced for this new technology. However, two of these parameters are highly correlated resulting in bad estimation performance when estimating all parameters. This paper proposes a new strategy improving estimation performance for delay/Doppler altimetry. The proposed strategy exploits all the information contained in the delay/Doppler domain. A comparison with other classical algorithms (using the temporal samples only) allows to appreciate the gain in estimation performance obtained when using both temporal and Doppler data.},

In existing approaches for solving the line outage identification problem the unobserved phasor angle data is ignored and identification is based on the observed phasor angles extracted from the data. We propose, instead, a least-squares approach for estimating the unobserved phasor angles, which is shown to yield a solution to the line outage identification problem that is equivalent to the solution obtained with existing approaches. This equivalence suggests an implementation of the solution to the line outage identification problem that is computationally more efficient than previous methods. A natural extension of the least-squares formulation leads to a generalization of the line outages identification problem in which the grid parameters are unknown.},

When, as it is the case for censored observations, the constraints on the Maximum Entropy estimator are derived from independent observations of a set of non-linear functions, this link is lost increasing the difference between the two criteria. By combining the two criteria we propose a novel density estimator that is able to overcome the singularities of the Maximum Likelihood estimator while maintaining a good fit to the observed data, and illustrate its behavior in real data (hyperbaric diving).},

Unlike these conventional studies, in this paper, we apply PLNC to a large-scale cellular network in the presence of intercell interference (ICI). In cellular networks, a terminal and a Base Station (BS) have different transmission power, which causes different impact of ICI on downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) phase.

Recently, adaptive schemes have been proposed, where only relays with correct estimates of the network coded message participate in the BC transmission. In this work, we extend the analysis by incorporating also the case, that some relays are able to detect only one source message and propose a corresponding modified adaptive transmission scheme. For performance evaluations we resort to a semi-analytical method in order to examine the outage behavior of the presented schemes. As demonstrated by link-level simulations, the proposed adaptive scheme outperforms the traditional scheme significantly, especially for asymmetric network topology.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an image retrieval system based on the bag-of-words model is developed, which contains a novel query expansion technique. SIFT image features are computed using the Hessian-Affine keypoint detector. All feature descriptors are taken into account for the bag-of-words representation by dividing the full set of descriptors into a number of subsets. For each subset, a partial vocabulary is created and the final vocabulary is obtained by the union of the partial vocabularies. Here, a new discriminative query expansion technique is proposed in which an SVM classifier is trained in order to obtain a decision boundary between the top ranked and the bottom ranked images. Treating this boundary as a new query, words appearing exclusively in top-ranked images are further boosted by rewarding them with larger weights. The images are re-ranked with respect to the their distance from the new boosted query. It is proved that this strategy improves image retrieval performance.},

  pages = {1173-1177},
  abstract = {Nowadays, walkers are prescribed based on subjective standards that lead to incorrect indication of such devices to patients. This leads to the increase of dissatisfaction and occurrence of discomfort and fall events. Therefore, it is necessary to objectively evaluate the effects that walker can have on the gait patterns of its users, comparatively to non-assisted gait. A gait analysis, focusing on spatiotemporal and kinematics parameters, will be issued for this purpose. However, gait analysis yields redundant information and this study addresses this problem by selecting the most relevant gait features required to differentiate between assisted and non-assisted gait. In order to do this, it is proposed an approach that combines multi-objective genetic and support vector machine algorithms to discriminate differences. Results with healthy subjects have shown that the main differences are characterized by balance and joints excursion. Thus, one can conclude that this technique is an efficient feature selection approach.},

  abstract = {Kernel techniques for classification is especially challenging in terms of computation and memory requirement when data fall into more than two categories. In this paper, we extend a binary classification technique called Ridge-adjusted Slack Variable Optimization (RiSVO) to its multiclass counterpart where the label information encoding scheme allows the computational complexity to remain the same to the binary case. The main features of this technique are summarized as follows: (1) Only a subset of data are pre-selected to construct the basis for kernel computation; (2) Simultaneous active training set selection for all classes helps reduce complexity meanwhile improving robustness; (3) With the proposed active set selection criteria, inclusion property is verified empirically. Inclusion property means that once a pattern is excluded, it will no longer return to the active training set and therefore can be permanently removed from the training procedure. This property greatly reduce the complexity. The proposed techniques are evaluated on standard multiclass datasets MNIST, USPS, pendigits and letter which could be easily compared with existing results.},

While refraining from any statistical and structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, we introduce a competitive approach to this problem and compare the performance of a sequential algorithm with respect to the large and continuous class of parametric predictors. We define the performance difference between a sequential algorithm and the best parametric predictor as “regret”, and introduce a guaranteed worst-case lower bounds to this relative performance measure. In particular, we prove that for any sequential algorithm, there always exists a sequence for which this regret is lower bounded by zero. We then extend this result by showing that the prediction problem can be transformed into a parameter estimation problem if the class of parametric predictors satisfy a certain property, and provide a comprehensive lower bound to this case.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the use of a variant of the nonparametric Bayesian (NPB) forward-backward (FB) method for sampling state sequences of hidden Markov models (HMMs), when the continuous-valued observations follow autoregressive (AR) processes. The goal is to get an accurate representation of the posterior probability of the state-sequence configuration. The advantage of using NPB samplers towards this end is well-known; one need not specify (or heuristically estimate) the number of states present in the model. Instead one uses hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) as priors for the state-transition probabilities to account for a potentially infinite number of states. The FB algorithm is known to increase the mixing rate of such samplers (compared to direct Gibbs), but can still yield significant spread in segmentation error. We show that by approximately integrating out some parameters of the model, one can alleviate this problem considerably.},

  abstract = {Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a recently proposed method to analyze non-linear and non-stationary time series by decomposing them into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). One of the most popular application of such a method is noise elimination. EMD based denoising methods require a robust threshold to determine which IMFs are noise related components. In this study, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is suggested to obtain such a threshold. The scaling exponential obtained by the root mean squared fluctuation is capable of distinguishing uncorrelated white Gaussian noise and anti-correlated signals. Therefore, in our method the slope of the scaling exponent is used as the threshold for EMD based denoising. IMFs with lower slope than the threshold are assumed to be noisy oscillations and excluded in the reconstruction step. The proposed method is tested on various signal to noise ratios (SNR) to show its denoising performance and reliability compared to several other methods.},

Then, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained in selected objective criteria applied on the denoised speech is used.

A new ABE approach that makes use of robust dynamic features and a Viterbi path decoder exploiting phonetic a priori knowledge proves to be superior.

Peak picking performed on this trajectory gives an estimate of the number of vowels in the utterance. To dispose of falsely detected vowels, a peak pruning post-processing step is incorporated. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the two speech rate determination algorithms on which it was inspired.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a speech watermarking method based on formant enhancement. The line spectral frequencies (LSFs) which can stably represent the formants were firstly derived from the speech signal by linear prediction (LP) analysis. A pair of LSFs were then symmetrically controlled to enhance formants for watermark embedding. Two kinds of objective experiments regarding inaudibility and robustness were carried out to evaluate the proposed method in comparison with other typical methods. The results indicated that the proposed method could not only satisfy inaudibility but also provide good robustness against different speech codecs and general processing, while the other methods encountered problems.},

The coefficient adaptation stepsize is controlled by an estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the primary input and a relative coefficient magnitude normalized by the reference power. The SNR is estimated based on the noise replica and the output, and converted to a stepsize by an exponential function. This stepsize provides robustness to interference by the desired speech. Conditional cancellation guarantees that the noisy signal power is reduced by noise-replica subtraction.

In the speech enhancement system optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA) uses the estimated noise spectrum obtained from the LBP based recursive averaging (LRA).

We consider scenarios where the noise field is spatially correlated between the nodes. Therefore, rather than an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD-) based approach, we apply a generalized EVD (GEVD-) based approach which allows to directly incorporate the (estimated) noise covariance. Furthermore, the GEVD is also immune to unknown per-channel scalings. We first use a distributed algorithm to estimate the principal generalized eigenvectors (GEVCs) of a pair of network-wide sensor signal covariance matrices, without explicitly constructing these matrices, as this would inherently require data centralization. We then apply a transformation at each node to extract the actual signal subspace estimate from the principal GEVCs. The resulting distributed algorithm can reduce the per-node communication and computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by means of numerical simulations.},

These techniques require the minimization of an energy function, which is typically a linear combination of a data-fit term and regularization terms. This energy function can be tailored to the intrinsic object and image features. This can be done by either modifying the actual terms or by changing the weighting parameters of the terms. There is, however, no sure way to set these terms and weighting parameters optimally for a given application. Although heuristic techniques exist for parameter estimation, often trial and error is used. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic interpretation to segmentation. This approach results in a generalization of state of the art active contour segmentation. In the proposed framework all parameters have a statistical interpretation, thus avoiding ad hoc parameter settings.},

Within this context, the Bag Of Visual Words (BoW) model, inherited from sampled video keyframes analysis, is among the most popular methods. However, in the case of image sequences, this model faces new difficulties such as the added motion information, the extra computational cost and the increased variability of content and concepts to handle. Considering this spatio-temporal context, we propose to extend the BoW model by introducing video preprocessing strategies with the help of a retina model, before extracting BoW descriptors. This preprocessing increases the robustness of local features to disturbances such as noise and lighting variations. Additionally, the retina model is used to detect potentially salient areas and to construct spatio-temporal descriptors. We experiment with three state of the art local features, SIFT, SURF and FREAK, and we evaluate our results on the TRECVid 2012 Semantic Indexing (SIN) challenge.},

This paper presents a novel method for accurate spatio-temporal reconstruction of rainfall maps, derived from CMN, by using an extension to object tracking algorithms. An efficient coherency algorithm is used, which relates between sequential instantaneous rainfall maps. Then by using Kalman filter, the observed rain maps are predicted and corrected. When comparing the estimates to actual rain measurements, the performance improvement of the rainfall mapping is manifested, even when dealing with a rather sparse network, and low temporal resolution of the measurements.

  abstract = {It has been shown that the Bayesian optimal approximate message passing (AMP) technique achieves the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) optimal compressed sensing (CS) recovery. However, the prerequisite of the signal prior makes it often impractical. To address this dilemma, we propose the parametric SURE-AMP algorithm. The key feature is it uses the Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) based parametric family of MMSE estimator for the CS denoising. Given that the optimization of the estimator and the calculation of its mean squared error purely depend on the noisy data, there is no need of the signal prior. The weighted sum of piecewise kernel functions is used to form the parametric estimator. Numerical experiments on both Bernoulli-Gaussian and k-dense signal justify our proposal.},

However, the performance of existing surround sound systems are degraded by factors like room reverberation and listener movements. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to spatial sound reproduction in reverberant environments, where room reverberation is constructively incorporated with the direct source signals to recreate a virtual reality. We also show that the array of monopole loudspeakers required for reproduction can be clustered together in a small spatial region away from the listening area, which in turn enables the array's practical implementation via a single loudspeaker unit with multiple drivers.},

For this purpose a new method is presented that separately optimizes the direct sound field and recreates a reverberant sound field in the playback room that matches that of the recording room. This approach optimizes monaural cues related to coloration and the interaural cross correlation (IACC), responsible for listener envelopment, in both rooms based on an artificial head placed at the listener's positions.

With this framework we show similarities and differences between known techniques and suggest some new, unexplored methods.

However, in the most sophisticated cases, criminals may introduce the biometric samples of innocent individuals in order to evade their own identities as well as to incriminate the innocent individuals. To date, even a minute suspect of an anti-forensic threat can potentially jeopardize any forensic investigation to the point that a potentially vital piece of evidence suddenly becomes powerless in the court of law. In order to remedy this situation, we propose an anti-forensic resistant likelihood ratio computation that renders the strength of evidence to a level that is proportional to the trustworthiness of the trace, such that a highly credible evidence will bear its full strength of evidence whilst a highly suspicious trace can have its strength of evidence reduced to naught. Using simulation as well as a spoof fingerprint database, we show that the existing likelihood ratio computation is extremely vulnerable to an anti-forensic threat whereas our proposed computation is robust to it, thereby striking the balance between the utility and threat of a trace.},

Moreover, the sampling rate depends upon the target's acceleration and heading and will therefore generally be time varying. When classifying radar tracks using temporal features, too low or highly varying sampling rates deteriorates the classifier's performance. In this work, we propose to model the temporal variations of the target's speed by low-order polynomial regression. Using the polynomial we obtain the conditional statistics of the targets speed at some future time given its speed at the current time. When used in a classifier based on Gaussian mixture models and with real radar data, it is shown that the inclusions of conditional statistics describing the targets temporal variations, leads to a substantial improvement in the overall classification performance.},

JBSS extends classical BSS to simultaneously resolve several BSS problems by assuming statistical dependence between latent sources across mixtures. JBSS offers some significant advantages over BSS, such as identifying more than one Gaussian white stationary source within a mixture. Multidimensional BSS extends classical BSS to deal with a more general and more flexible model within each mixture: the sources can be partitioned into groups exhibiting dependence within a given group but independence between two different groups. Motivated by various applications, we present a model that is inspired by both extensions. We derive an algorithm that achieves asymptotically the minimal mean square error (MMSE) in the estimation of Gaussian multidimensional components. We demonstrate the superior performance of this model over a two-step approach, in which JBSS, which ignores the multidimensional structure, is followed by a clustering step.},

  pages = {1432-1436},
  abstract = {Traditional hierarchical techniques are used in many areas of research. However, they require the user to set the number of clusters or use some external criterion to find them. Also, they are unable to identify varying internal structures in classes, i.e. classes can be represented as unions of clusters. To overcome these issues, we propose a family of agglomerative hierarchical methods, which integrates a high-order dissimilarity measure, called dissimilarity increments, in traditional linkage algorithms. Dissimilarity increments are a measure over triplets of nearest neighbors. This family of algorithms is able to automatically find the number of clusters using a minimum description length criterion based on the dissimilarity increments distribution. Moreover, each algorithm of the proposed family is able to find classes as unions of clusters, leading to the identification of internal structures of classes. Experimental results show that any algorithm from the proposed family outperforms the traditional ones.},

  abstract = {The Phonocardiogram (PCG) is the graphical representation of acoustic energy due to the mechanical cardiac activity. Sometimes cardiac diseases provide pathological murmurs mixed with the main components of the Heart Sound Signal (HSs). The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) allows decomposing a multicomponent signal into a set of monocomponent signals, called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Each IMF represents an oscillatory mode with one instantaneous frequency. The goal of this paper is to segment some pathological HSs by selecting the most appropriate IMFs using the correlation coefficient. Then we extract some time-frequency characteristics considered as useful parameters to distinguish different cases of heart diseases. The experimental results conducted on some real-life pathological HSs such as: Mitral Regurgitation (MR), Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and the Opening Snap (OS) case; revealed the performance of the proposed method.},

  pages = {1442-1446},
  abstract = {Unwanted `spike noise' in a digital signal is a common problem in digital filtering. However, sometimes the spikes are wanted and other, superimposed, signals are unwanted, and linear, time invariant (LTI) filtering is ineffective because the spikes are wideband - overlapping with independent noise in the frequency domain. So, no LTI filter can separate them, necessitating nonlinear filtering. However, there are applications in which the `noise' includes drift or smooth signals for which LTI filters are ideal. We describe a nonlinear filter formulated as the solution to an elastic net regularization problem, which attenuates band-limited signals and independent noise, while enhancing superimposed spikes. Making use of known analytic solutions a novel, approximate path-following algorithm is given that provides a good, filtered output with reduced computational effort by comparison to standard convex optimization methods. Accurate performance is shown on real, noisy electrophysiological recordings of neural spikes.},

These approaches have been applied to one of the most used PD datasets, which contains repeated measurements in an imbalanced design. Most of the published methodologies applied to perform classification from this dataset fail to account for the dependent nature of the data. This fact artificially increases the sample size and leads to a diffuse criterion to define which subject is suffering from PD. The first proposed approach is based on data aggregation. This reduces the sample size, but defines a clear criterion to discriminate subjects. The second one handles repeated measurements by introducing latent variables in a Bayesian logistic regression framework. The proposed approaches are conceptually simple and easy to implement.},

The common approach uses a bank of 2D Gabor filters to process the speech signal spectrogram and generate the output feature vector. This approach suffers from generating a large number of coefficients, thus necessitating the use of feature dimensionality reduction. The proposed Gaussian Power flow Orientation Coefficients (GPOCs) use an alternative approach in which only the largest coefficients output from a bank of 2D Gaussian kernels are used to describe the spectro-temporal patterns of power flow in the auditory spectrogram. Whilst reducing the size of the feature vectors, the algorithm was shown to outperform traditional feature extraction methods, even a reference spectro-temporal approach, for low SNRs. Its performance for high SNRs is comparable but inferior to traditional ASR frontends, while falling behind state-of-the-art algorithms in all noise scenarios.},

In this paper, an adaptive sinusoidal model (aSM), dubbed extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model - eaQHM, is employed to analyze emotional speech in accurate, robust, continuous, timevarying parameters (amplitude, frequency, and phase). It is shown that these parameters can adequately and accurately represent emotional speech content. Using a well known database of narrowband expressive speech (SUSAS) we show that very high Signal-to-Reconstruction-Error Ratio (SRER) values can be obtained, compared to the standard sinusoidal model (SM). Formal listening tests on a smaller wideband speech database show that the eaQHM outperforms SM from a perceptual resynthesis quality point of view. Finally, preliminary emotion classification tests show that the parameters obtained from the adaptive model lead to a higher classification score, compared to the standard SM parameters.},

The previous algorithms based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation result in high signal model complexity which i) makes them computationally unfeasible or not intended for real time applications such as intensive care monitoring and (ii) in which the parameter selection conditions the overall performance. A simplified model based on the independent Gaussian properties of the DFT coefficients is proposed. This model allows to define a simplified MAP probability function and to define an adaptive MAP statistical test in which a global hypothesis is defined on particular hypotheses of the multiple observation window. Moreover, the observation interval is modeled as a discontinuous transmission discrete-time stochastic process avoiding the inclusion of parameters that constraint the morphology of the QRS complexes.},

  abstract = {Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a cardiac disease associated with the decreases in cardiac output. As a measure to predict sudden death, we propose a framework for discriminating CHF subjects from normal sinus rhythm (NSR). This framework relies on matching pursuit decomposition to derive a set of features, which are tested in a hybrid genetic algorithm and k-nearest neighbor classifier to select the best feature subset. The performance of the proposed framework is analyzed using both Fantasia and CHF database from Physionet archives which are, respectively, composed of 40 NSR volunteers and 29 CHF subjects. The proposed methodology reaches an overall accuracy of 100% when the features are normalized and the feature subset selection strategy is applied. We believe that our method can be extremely useful to the clinician in primary health care as a support tool to discriminate healthy from CHF subjects.},

The high computational cost of similarity evaluation based on musical features between a pair of music clips is a crucial problem especially for searching large music database. To reduce the computational time in similarity evaluation process, the proposed method adopts an approach called indirect matching. In the approach, a small number of music clips called representative queries, which are randomly selected from a database, are used for fast computation. As an offline process, the similarities of each music clip in the database to the representative queries are recorded as a similarity table. In the online phase, the similarity between the actual query (the music clip given by a user) and each music clip in the database is quickly estimated by referring the similarity table. Experimental results have shown that the execution time of retrieval can be greatly reduced by the indirect matching without much deterioration of retrieval accuracy.},

To address this inverse problem, the use of learning methods have been considered with the advantage that, once a relationship between physical parameters and spectra has been established through training, the learnt relationship can be used to estimate parameters from new images underpinned by the same physical model. Within this framework, we propose a partially-latent regression method which maps high-dimensional inputs (spectral images) onto low-dimensional responses (physical parameters). We introduce a novel regression method that combines a Gaussian mixture of locally-linear mappings with a partially-latent variable model. While the former makes high-dimensional regression tractable, the latter enables to deal with physical parameters that cannot be observed or, more generally, with data contaminated by experimental artifacts that cannot be explained with noise models. The method is illustrated on images collected from the Mars planet.},

The observed images are assumed to be obtained by spectral or spatial degradations of the high resolution hyperspectral image to be recovered. Based on this forward model, the fusion process is formulated as an inverse problem whose solution is determined by optimizing an appropriate criterion. To incorporate additional spatial information within the objective criterion, a regularization term is carefully designed, relying on a sparse decomposition of the scene on a set of dictionaries. The dictionaries and the corresponding supports of active coding coefficients are learned from the observed images. Then, conditionally on these dictionaries and supports, the fusion problem is solved by iteratively optimizing with respect to the target image (using the alternating direction method of multipliers) and the coding coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed fusion method when compared with the state-of-the-art.},

The minimum volume simplex analysis (MVSA) is one of such methods which, as many others, estimates the minimum volume (MV) simplex where the measured vectors live. MVSA was conceived to circumvent the matrix factorization step often implemented by MV based algorithms and also to cope with outliers, which compromise the results produced by MV algorithms. Inspired by the recently proposed robust minimum volume estimation (RMVES) algorithm, we herein introduce the robust MVSA (RMVSA), which is a version of MVSA robust to noise. As in RMVES, the robustness is achieved by employing chance constraints, which control the volume of the resulting simplex. RMVSA differs, however, substantially from RMVES in the way optimization is carried out. The effectiveness of RVMSA is illustrated by comparing its performance in simulated data with the state-of-the-art.},

In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for tone mapping high dynamic range (HDR) images which are generated using physically based renderers. Our work exploits information of a 3D scene, such as geometry, materials, luminaries, etc. This allows to limit the assumptions that are typically made during the tone mapping step.

  abstract = {A common paradigm to code high dynamic range (HDR) image/video content is based on tone-mapping HDR pictures to low dynamic range (LDR), in order to obtain backward compatibility and use existing coding tools, and then use inverse tone mapping at the decoder to predict the original HDR signal. Clearly, the choice of a proper tone mapping is essential in order to achieve good coding performance. The state-of-the-art to design the optimal tone mapping operator (TMO) minimizes the mean-square-error distortion between the original and the predicted HDR image. In this paper, we argue that this is suboptimal in rate-distortion sense, and we propose a more effective TMO design strategy that takes into account also the spatial complexity (which is a proxy for the bitrate) of the coded LDR image. Our results show that the proposed optimization approach enables to obtain substantial coding gain with respect to the minimum-MSE TMO.},

In this work, we present a GPU based rendering system based on the NVIDIA OptiX [1] framework, enabling real time raytracing of scenes illuminated with video environment maps. For this purpose, we explore and compare several Monte Carlo sampling approaches, including bidirectional importance sampling, multiple importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo samplers. While previous work have focused on synthetic data and overly simple environment map sequences, we have collected a set of real world dynamic environment map sequences using a state-of-art HDR video camera for evaluation and comparisons. Based on the result we show that in contrast to CPU renderers, for a GPU implementation multiple importance sampling and bidirectional importance sampling provide better results than sequential Monte Carlo samplers in terms of flexibility, computational efficiency and robustness.},

Thus, two colors that trigger the same impression are most likely considered to be more similar than two colors which trigger the opposite impression. We introduce a new feature called image warmness. It is based on the cold or warm impression that a single color triggers in the brain of the beholder. Image warmness provides a measure about how cold or warm an entire image is perceived by humans based on colors it contains. In a survey and evaluation with 90 images and 101 participants we show that the values of image warmness calculated by the proposed formula are close to the average rating of the survey participants.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges of feature extraction in image processing is caused by the fact that objects originating from a feature class don't always appear in a unique size, and the feature sizes are diverse. Hence, a multiresolution analysis using wavelets should be suitable. Because of their integer scaling factors classical dyadic or M-channel wavelet filter banks often don't match very well the corresponding feature sizes occurring within the image. This paper presents a new method to optimally extract features in different sizes by designing a rational biorthogonal wavelet filter bank, which matches both the features' characteristics and the significant sizes of the most dominant features' sizes. This is achieved by matching the rational downsampling factor to the different feature sizes and matching the filter coefficients to the feature characteristics. The presented method is evaluated with the detection of defects on specular surfaces and of contaminations on manufactured metal surfaces.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of target detection for multiple-input multiple- output with colocated antennas on a moving airborne platform. The target's radar cross section fluctuations degrade the detection performance of the radar. In this paper, first, we introduce a spatiotemporal signal model for airborne colocated MIMO radar which handles arbitrary transmit and receive antennas placement. Then, we employ the likelihood ratio test to derive the decision rules for fluctuating and nonfluctuating targets. In the case offull knowledge of target and interference statistic characteristics, we propose two detectors for fluctuating and nonfluctuating targets. The proposed detector can be used to evaluate adaptive detectors such as Kelly detector where the interference covariance matrix is estimated using training data. Simulation results have been provided to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed detectors.},

The cfcarness property is assured by use of the Weber-Haykin (WH) adaptive thresholding which bypasses the estimation of the distribution parameters. The censoring algorithm starts up by considering the two most left ranked cells and proceeds forward. The selected homogeneous set is used to estimate the unknown background level.

  abstract = {Change-point detection problems can be solved either by variational approaches based on total variation or by Bayesian procedures. The former class leads to small computational time but requires the choice of a regularization parameter that significantly impacts the achieved solution and whose automated selection remains a challenging problem. Bayesian strategies avoid this regularization parameter selection, at the price of high computational costs. In this contribution, we propose a hybrid Bayesian variational procedure that relies on the use of a hierarchical Bayesian model while preserving the computational efficiency of total variation optimization procedures. Behavior and performance of the proposed method compare favorably against those of a fully Bayesian approach, both in terms of accuracy and of computational time. Additionally, estimation performance are compared to the Stein unbiased risk estimate, for which the knowledge of the noise variance is needed.},

In this paper we show how well-known K-Best detection can be modified to approximately solve this finite alphabet Compressed Sensing problem. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust against parameter variations and even works in cases where fewer measurements than unknown sources are available.},

  abstract = {Compressed sensing allows for a significant reduction of the number of measurements when the signal of interest is of a sparse nature. Most computationally efficient algorithms for signal recovery rely on some knowledge of the sparsity level, i.e., the number of non-zero elements. However, the sparsity level is often not known a priori and can even vary with time. In this contribution we show that it is possible to estimate the sparsity level directly in the compressed domain, provided that multiple independent observations are available. In fact, one can use classical model order selection algorithms for this purpose. Nevertheless, due to the influence of the measurement process they may not perform satisfactorily in the compressed sensing setup. To overcome this drawback, we propose an approach which exploits the empirical distributions of the noise eigenvalues. We demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art model order estimation algorithms numerically.},

Given a small amount of speech from a new speaker, is it better to apply speaker adaptation, or to use accent identification (AID) to identify the speaker's accent followed by accent-dependent ASR? Three approaches to accent-dependent modelling are investigated: using the `correct' accent model, choosing a model using supervised (ACCDIST-based) accent identification (AID), and building a model using data from neighbouring speakers in `AID space'. All of the methods outperform the accent-independent model, with relative reductions in ASR error rate of up to 44%.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the robustness of the warped discrete Fourier transform (WDFT)-based cepstral features for continuous speech recognition under clean and multistyle training conditions. In the MFCC and PLP front-ends, in order to approximate the nonlinear characteristics of the human auditory system in frequency, the speech spectrum is warped using the Mel-scale filterbank, which typically consists of overlapping triangular filters. It is well known that such nonlinear frequency transformation-based features provide better speech recognition accuracy than linear frequency scale features. It has been found that warping the DFT spectrum directly, rather than using filterbank averaging, provides a more precise approximation to the perceptual scales. WDFT provides non-uniform resolution filter-banks whereas DFT provides uniform resolution filter-banks. Here, we provide a performance evaluation of the following variants of the warped cepstral features: WDFT, and WDFT-linear prediction-based MFCC features. Experiments were carried out on the AURORA-4 task. Experimental results demonstrate that the WDFT-based cepstral features outperform the conventional MFCC and PLP both in clean and multistyle training conditions in terms of recognition error rates.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel class-dependent extension of two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) named CD-2DLDA, applied in automatic speech recognition using two-pass recognition strategy. In the first pass, the class labels of test sample are obtained using baseline recognition. The labels are then used in CD transformation of test features. In the second pass, recognition of previously transformed test samples is performed using CD-2DLDA acoustic model. The novelty of the paper lies in improvement of the present 2DLDA algorithm by its modification to more precise, class-dependent estimations repeated separately for each class. The proposed approach is evaluated in several scenarios using the TIMIT corpus in phoneme-based continuous speech recognition task. CD-2DLDA features are compared to state-of-the-art MFCCs, conventional LDA and 2DLDA features. The experimental results show that our method performs better than MFCCs and LDA. Furthermore, the results confirm that CD-2DLDA markedly outperforms the 2DLDA method.},

The conditional fuzzy entropy is then maximized to find the set of optimal thresholds to extract different types of vessel silhouettes from the background. Differential Evolution algorithm is used to specify the optimal combination of the fuzzy parameters. Thresholds thus obtained extract the thin, the medium and the thick vessels from the enhanced image which are then logically OR-ed to obtain the entire vascular tree.

One of the main advantages of FBMC, when compared to traditional cyclic prefix based OFDM, is its higher spectral efficiency. However, this gain can be lost again if the problem of training based channel estimation is not tackled correctly. This is due to the memory inserted by the longer pulse shaping and the loss of orthogonality of overlapping subcarriers.

In particular, we will look into iterative maximum likelihood parameter estimation based on expectation maximization algorithm and its application in coherent optical communication systems for linear and nonlinear impairment mitigation. Furthermore, the estimated parameters are used to build the probabilistic model of the system for the synthetic impairment generation. It is shown numerically and experimentally that iterative parameter estimation based on expectation maximization algorithm is a powerful tool in combating system impairments such as non-linear phase noise, inphase and quadrature (I/Q) modulator imperfections and laser linewidth. We show experimentally that for a dispersion managed polarization multiplexed 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system at 14 Gbaud a gain in the nonlinear system tolerance of up to 3 dB can be obtained. For, a dispersion unmanaged system this gain reduces to 0.5 dB. Moreover, we show that joint estimation of carrier frequency, phase, signal means and noise covariance, can be performed iteratively by employing expectation maximization. Using experimental data we show that joint carrier synchronization and detection offers an improvement of 0.5 dB in terms of input power compared to hard decision digital phaselocked loop (PLL) based carrier synchronization and demodulation.},

In this paper a 2-D AOA estimator is presented which requires only a 1-D antenna array. This presented method is named Estimation of 2-D Angle of arrival using Reduced antenna array dimension (EAR). The EAR estimator utilises the antenna radiation pattern factor to reduce the required antenna array dimensionality. Thus, 2-D AOA estimation is possible using antenna arrays of reduced size and with a minimum of two elements only, which is very beneficial in applications with size and space limitations.

We can then estimate the DOA from the time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates. However, many conventional DOA estimators based on TDOA estimates are not optimal in colored noise. In this paper, we estimate the DOA of a harmonic signal source from multi-channel phase estimates, which relate to narrowband TDOA estimates. More specifically, we design filters to apply on phase estimates to obtain a DOA estimate with minimum variance. Using a linear array and harmonic constraints, we design optimal filters based on estimated noise statistics. Therefore, the proposed method is robust against different noise scenarios. In colored noise, simulation results confirm that the proposed method outperforms an optimal state-of-the-art weighted least-squares (WLS) DOA estimator.},

Such calibration arises in several applications such as calibration of (acoustic or ultra-sound) microphone arrays, and radio antenna networks. We propose a non-iterative algorithm based on recent stratified approaches: (i) rank constraints on modified measurement matrix, (ii) factorization techniques that determine transmitters and receivers up to unknown affine transformation and (iii) determining the affine stratification using remaining non-linear constraints. This results in a unified approach to solve almost all minimal problems. Such algorithms are important components for systems for self-localization. Experiments are shown both for simulated and real data with promising results.},

In this approach, at each step, the transmit beampattern is determined based on previous observations. The criterion used for waveform design is the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for estimation of the unknown system parameters.

  abstract = {This paper is focused on the decentralized localization problem of mobile sensors in wireless sensor networks. Based on a combined localization technique, it uses accelerometer, gyroscope and fingerprinting information to solve the positioning issue. Using the sensors mobility, the proposed method computes first estimates of sensors positions. It then proceeds to a decentralized localization scheme, where the network is divided to different zones. RSSIs fingerprints are jointly used with mobility information in order to compute position estimates. Final position estimates are obtained by means of interval analysis where all uncertainties are considered throughout the estimation process.},

The noise due to magnetic fields and radio frequencies corrupts significantly the EMG signal which render its extraction very difficult. The proposed approach operes in the frequency domain to estimate the noise spectrum to subtract it from noisy observation spectrum. The noise estimation is based on spectral minima tracking in each frequency bin without any distinction between muscle activity and muscle rest. But it looks for connected time-frequency regions of muscle activity presence to estimate a bias compensation factor. The method is tested with a simulated noisy observation in order to evaluate its performance using objective criteria. It is also validated for real noisy observations where no clean is available.},

  abstract = {Electrically evoked auditory steady state responses (EASSRs) are EEG signals measured in response to periodic or modulated pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant (CI). EASSRs are studied for the objective fitting of CIs in infants, as electrophysiological thresholds determined with EASSRs correlate well with behavioural thresholds. Currently available techniques to remove CI artifacts from such measurements are only able to deal with artifacts for low-rate pulse trains or modulated pulse trains presented in bipolar mode, which are not used in main clinical practice. In this paper, an automatic EASSR CI artifact rejection technique based on independent component analysis (ICA) is presented that is suitable for clinical parameters. Artifactual independent components are selected based on the spectral amplitude of the pulse rate. Electrophysiological thresholds determined based on ICA compensated signals are equal to those detected using blanked signals, but measurements at only one modulation frequency are required.},

One group of non-pathological subjects performed a set of trials at different workloads and cadence values, to analyze the effect of these variables on force output.

Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has recently been commercialized to monitor microvascular blood flow. From laser speckle contrast images, velocity of microvascular moving scatterers (mainly red blood cells) can be computed when a profile for velocity distribution is assumed. Our goal herein is to analyze if alterations of microcirculation with age can be determined by processing experimental LSCI data. In our work a Lorentzian velocity profile is assumed and the presence of static scatterers, like skin, is taken into account. Our results show that moving scatterers velocities computed from LSCI data vary with age: blood cells velocities increase with age. Moreover, the more the static scatterers, the higher the moving scatterers velocity values. Our findings are a first step in the analysis of the impact of aging from the processing of laser speckle contrast images.},

This paper presents a method of extracting the HRTF spectral cues using cepstral analysis for speech source localization in the median plane. Binaural signals are preprocessed in the cepstral domain so that the fine spectral structure of speech and the HRTF spectral envelope can be easily separated. We introduce (i) a truncated cepstral transformation to extract the relevant localization cues, and (ii) a mechanism to normalize the effects of the time varying speech spectra. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with a convolution based localization method using a speech corpus of multiple speakers. The results suggest that the proposed method fully exploits the available spectral cues for robust speaker independent binaural source localization in the median plane.},

Current state-of-the-art solutions widely use cepstral features as a front-end for HMM based frameworks. Although the automatic segmentation results have reached the inter-annotator agreement, within a tolerance equal or higher than 20ms, the same is not true when a lower tolerance is considered. We propose a new set of cepstral features that derive from the time-frequency reassigned spectrogram and offer a sharper representation of the speech signal in the cepstral domain. The features are evaluated through a series of forced alignment experiments which demonstrate a better performance, compared to the traditional MFCC features, in aligning phone boundaries within a small distance from their true position.},

  abstract = {The dissimilarity between the training and test data in speech recognition systems is known to have a considerable effect on the recognition accuracy. To solve this problem, we use density forest to cluster the data and use maximum a posteriori (MAP) method to build a cluster-based adapted Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in HMM speech recognition. Specifically, a set of bagged versions of the training data for each state in the HMM is generated, and each of these versions is used to generate one GMM and one tree in the density forest. Thereafter, an acoustic model forest is built by replacing the data of each leaf (cluster) in each tree with the corresponding GMM adapted by the leaf data using the MAP method. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 3:8% (absolute) lower phone error rate compared with the standard HMM/GMM and 0:8% (absolute) lower PER compared with bagged HMM/GMM.},

It is however not clear if the extra details in tone mapped HDR affect user preferences over a single exposure content in terms of scene appearance and to what extent. This paper aims to shed light on this issue via a comprehensive subjective study.

  abstract = {Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) has been recognized as an efficient solution to improve the spectral efficiency of future communication systems. However, increasing the number of antennas and users goes hand-in-hand with increasing computational complexity. In particular, the precoding design becomes involved since near-optimal precoding, such as regularized-zero forcing (RZF), requires the inversion of a large matrix. In our previous work [1] we proposed to solve this issue in the single-cell case by approximating the matrix inverse by a truncated polynomial expansion (TPE), where the polynomial coefficients are selected for optimal system performance. In this paper, we generalize this technique to multi-cell scenarios.

Particularly, we define a new continuous scalar function, used for Reeb graph construction. This function is based on the heat diffusion properties. Clusters are obtained according to the values of scalar function while adding a refinement step. The latter is based on curvature information in order to adjust segmentation boundaries.

  abstract = {The recently emerged Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has widely addressed the problem of sparse targets detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in the aim of reducing the deployment cost and energy consumption. In this paper, we apply CS approach for both sparse events recovery and counting. We first propose a novel Greedy version of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (GOMP) algorithm allowing to account for the decomposition matrix non orthogonality. Then, in order to reduce the GOMP computational load, we propose a two-stages version of GOMP, the 2S-GOMP, which separates the events detection and counting steps. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a better tradeoff between performance and computational load when compared to the recently proposed GMP algorithm and its two stages version denoted 2S-GMP.},

Solving these minimal problems is essential to robust estimation of microphone and sound source locations. We identify for each of these minimal problems the number of solutions in general and develop non-iterative solvers. We show that the proposed solvers are numerically stable in synthetic experiments.

  abstract = {Owing to the inherent sparsity of the target scene, compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully employed in radar applications. It is known that the performance of target scene recovery in CS scenarios depends highly on the coherence of the sensing matrix (CSM), which is determined by the radar transmit waveform. In this paper, we present a cyclic optimization algorithm to effectively reduce the CSM via a judicious design of the radar waveform. The proposed method provides a reduction in the size of the Gram matrix associated with the sensing matrix, and moreover, relies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations to improve the computation speed. As a result, the suggested algorithm can be used for large dimension designs (with ≲ 100 variables) even on an ordinary PC. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through numerical examples.},

  abstract = {A compelling method to calibrate the positions of microphones in an array is with sources at unknown locations. Remarkably, it is possible to reconstruct the locations of both the sources and the receivers, if their number is larger than some prescribed minimum [1, 2]. Existing methods, based on times of arrival or time differences of arrival, only exploit the direct paths between the sources and the receivers. In this proof-of-concept paper, we observe that by placing the whole setup inside a room, we can reduce the number of sources required for calibration. Moreover, our technique allows us to compute the absolute position of the microphone array in the room, as opposed to knowing it up to a rigid transformation or reflection. The key observation is that echoes correspond to virtual sources that we get “for free”. This enables endeavors such as calibrating the array using only a single source.},

Then, a DNN is trained to map from acoustic features to these duration-normalised glottal waveforms. At synthesis time, acoustic features are generated froma statistical parametricmodel, and from these, the trained DNN predicts the glottal flow waveform. Illustrations are provided to demonstrate that the proposed method successfully synthesises the glottal flow waveform and enables easy modification of the waveform by adjusting the input values to the DNN.

  abstract = {We propose a method for vocal tract estimation that is better than Bozkurt's chirp group delay method [1] and its zero-phase variant [2]. The chirp group delay method works only for voiced speech, is critically dependent on finding the glottal closure instants (GCI), deteriorates in performance when more than two pitch cycles are included for analysis, and does not work for unvoiced speech. The zero-phase variant eliminates these drawbacks but works poorly for nasal sounds. In our proposed method all outside-unit-circle zeros are reflected inside before computing the chirp group delay. The advantages are: (a) GCI knowledge not required, (b) the vocal tract estimate is far less sensitive to the location and duration of the analysis window, (c) works for unvoiced sounds, and (d) captures the spectral valleys well for nasals, which in turn leads to better recognition accuracy.},

First, the lip termination area is estimated via a facial capture software. Then, the area function is constrained in such a way that it does not get too far from a neutral position, and it does not change too quickly from a temporal frame to the next, when dealing with dynamic inversion. The method proves to be efficient to approximate the area function and the length of the vocal tract for oral french vowels, both in static and dynamic configurations.},

In this paper, we improve upon the earlier used NQR signal model, introducing an observed amplitude modulation of the spectral lines as a function of the sample temperature. This dependency noticeably affects the achievable identification performance in the typical case when the substance temperature is not perfectly known.

We consider neurologist as the best available benchmark for system's learning. In this article, we propose an `alive' system, capable of improving its performance by taking clinician's feedback into consideration. The system is based on taking DWT transform which has been shown to be very effective for EEG signal analysis. PCA is applied on the statistical features which are extracted from DWT coefficients before classification by an SVM classifier. After corrective marking of few epochs the initial average accuracy of 94.8% raised to 95.12.},

  abstract = {In order to quickly curb infections or prevent spreading of rumors, first the source of diffusion needs to be localized. We analyze the problem of source localization, based on infection times of a subset of nodes in incompletely observed tree networks, under a simple propagation model. Our scenario reflects the assumption that having access to all the nodes and full network topology is often not feasible. We evaluate the number of possible topologies that are consistent with the observed incomplete tree. We provide a sufficient condition for the selection of observed nodes, such that correct localization is possible, i.e. the network is observable. Finally, we formulate the source localization problem under these assumptions as a binary linear integer program. We then provide a small simulation example to illustrate the effect of the number of observed nodes on the problem complexity and on the number of possible solutions for the source.},

Unlike previous work in the literature, where agents try to reach consensus on a scalar or vector, here we investigate how agents can reach a consensus on a continuous probability distribution. In our setting, the agents fuse functions instead of point estimates. The objective is that every agent ends up with the belief being the global Bayesian posterior. We show that to achieve the objective, the agents need to know the number of total agents in the network. In many scenarios, this number is not available and therefore the global Bayesian posterior is not achievable. In such cases, we have to resort to approximation methods. We confine ourselves to Gaussian cases and formulate the optimization problem for them. Then we propose two methods for the selection of weighting coefficients used for combining information from neighbors in the fusion process. We also provide results of simulation that demonstrate the performance of the methods.},

We derive the joint posterior of the parameters of interest and the covariance, and we propose several approximations to make the Bayesian estimation tractable. Then we propose a method for forming a pseudo posterior, which is suitable for settings where estimation over networks is applied. By computer simulations, we demonstrate that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pseudo posterior and a posterior obtained from a known covariance decreases as the acquisition of new observations continues.

Aiming at an increased performance, the usual model-based approach employed for sound recognition or detection can be extended to other co-occurrent tasks like source localization, so both tasks can be carried out jointly, using the same formulation and processing. In this paper, we intend to illustrate that point by presenting together a few new model-based techniques that deal with the problems of overlapped-sounds recognition, multi-source localization, and channel selection. They are briefly described, and tested in a smart-room environment with a multiple microphone-array setup.},

As a result, a single combined confusion network is generated from multiple lattices. The approach offers a novel perspective to solutions based on confusion network combination. The method was evaluated in a simulated domestic environment equipped with largely spaced microphones. The experimental evidence suggests that results, comparable or, in some cases, better than the state of the art, can be achieved under optimal configurations with the proposed method.},

As an example, context depths as large as 32 are attainable for alphabets of four symbols, as is the case of genomic sequences. These deeper context models show very high compression capabilities in very repetitive genomic sequences, yielding improvements over previous algorithms.

The experimental results show that all the proposed gait image representations produce better accuracy than the previous methods. In addition, we have also developed Fusion GDEs (FGDEs) which achieve better overall accuracy and outperform the previous methods.},

  abstract = {The presence of significant levels of signal variability in face-portrait type of images, due to differences in illumination, pose and expression, is generally been accepted as having an adverse effect on the overall performance of i) face modeling and synthesis (FM/S) and also on ii) face recognition (FR) systems. Furthermore, the dependency on such input data variability and thus the sensitivity, with respect to face synthesis performance, of Active Appearance Modeling (AAM), is also well understood. As a result, the Multi-Model Active Appearance Model (MM-AAM) technique [1] has been developed and shown to possess a superior face synthesis performance than AAM. This paper considers the applicability in FR applications of both AAM and MM-AAM face modeling and synthesis approaches. Thus, a MM-AAM methodology has been devised that is tailored to operate successfully within the context of face recognition. Experimental results show FR-MM-AAM to be significantly superior to conventional FR-AAM.},

We suggest a supervised learning approach to this audio-visual fusion problem, on the following grounds. Firstly, we use a Gaussian mixture of locally-linear regressions to learn a mapping from image locations to binaural spectrograms. Secondly, we derive a closed-form expression for the conditional posterior probability of an image location, given both an observed spectrogram, emitted from an unknown source direction, and the mapping parameters that were previously learnt. Prominently, the proposed method is able to deal with completely different spectrograms for training and for alignment. While fixed-length wide-spectrum sounds are used for learning, thus fully and robustly estimating the regression, variable-length sparse-spectrum sounds, e.g., speech, are used for alignment. The proposed method successfully extracts the image location of speech utterances in realistic reverberant-room scenarios.},

While it showed success in revealing new insights into the biology of yeast, it has never been applied to bacteria. In this study, we apply Bi-CoPaM to five bacterial datasets, identifying two clusters of genes as the most consistently co-expressed. Strikingly, their average profiles are consistently negatively correlated in most of the datasets.

For feature generation, kernel PCA has shown its superiority over PCA in various applications, since it can implicitly exploit nonlinear relationship among features and such relationship seems to exist generally.

With the new feature, we found similar fMRI results compared with those by PCA features, indicating that kernel PCA assists to capture more properties of the naturalistic music stimulus.},

  abstract = {This work analyses the feasibility of electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics using signals from a novel single arm single-lead acquisition methodology. These new signals are used and analysed in a biometric recognition system in verification mode for validation of a person's identity enrolled in a system database. The algorithm used for recognition in the proposed system is the Autocorrelation/Linear Discriminant Analysis (AC/LDA), which is combined with preprocessing stages tuned to the characteristics for ECG from the single arm. The signal is collected from 23 subjects in three scenarios and performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated. Considerably low Equal Error Rate of 4.34% is obtained using the described method, establishing the utility of these signals as viable candidates for ECG Biometrics.},

  title = {Personalizing a smartwatch-based gesture interface with transfer learning},
  year = {2014},
  pages = {2530-2534},
  abstract = {The widespread adoption of mobile devices has lead to an increased interest toward smartphone-based solutions for supporting visually impaired users. Unfortunately the touch-based interaction paradigm commonly adopted on most devices is not convenient for these users, motivating the study of different interaction technologies. In this paper, following up on our previous work, we consider a system where a smartwatch is exploited to provide hands-free interaction through arm gestures with an assistive application running on a smartphone. In particular we focus on the task of effortlessly customizing the gesture recognition system with new gestures specified by the user. To address this problem we propose an approach based on a novel transfer metric learning algorithm, which exploits prior knowledge about a predefined set of gestures to improve the recognition of user-defined ones, while requiring only few novel training samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation.},
