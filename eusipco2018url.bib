  abstract = {Real-world acoustic events span a wide range of time and frequency resolutions, from short clicks to longer tonals. This is a challenge for the hidden Markov model (HMM), which uses a fixed segmentation and feature extraction, forcing a compromise between time and frequency resolution. The multiresolution HMM (MR-HMM) is an extension of the HMM that assumes not only an underlying (hidden) random state sequence, but also an underlying random segmentation, with segments spanning a wide range of sizes and processed using a variety of feature extraction methods. It is shown that the MR-HMM alone, as an acoustic event classifier, has performance comparable to state of the art discriminative classifiers on three open data sets. However, as a generative classifier, the MR-HMM models the underlying data generation process and can generate synthetic data, allowing weaknesses of individual class models to be discovered and corrected. To demonstrate this point, the MR-HMM is combined with auxiliary features that capture temporal information, resulting in significantly improved performance.},

  abstract = {The use of dual-microphones is a powerful tool for noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). In particular, it allows the reformulation of classical techniques like vector Taylor series (VTS) feature compensation. In this work, we consider a critical issue of VTS compensation such as posterior computation and propose an alternative way to estimate more accurately these probabilities when VTS is applied to enhance noisy speech captured by dual-microphone mobile devices. Our proposal models the conditional dependence of a noisy secondary channel given a primary one not only to outperform single-channel VTS feature compensation, but also a previous dual-channel VTS approach based on a stacked formulation. This is confirmed by recognition experiments on two different dual-channel extensions of the Aurora-2 corpus. Such extensions emulate the use of a dual-microphone smartphone in close- and far-talk conditions, obtaining our proposal relevant improvements in the latter case.},

We conduct tests with the proposed approach by using it as initialization of unconstrained alternating least squares in difficult cases, when the underlying tensor model factors have nearly collinear columns and the unconstrained approach is prone to a degenerate behavior, failing to converge or converging slowly to an acceptable solution. The results of the tested cases indicate that by using such an initialization the unconstrained approach seems to avoid such a behavior.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {499-503},
  abstract = {Distributed sensor data acquisition usually encompasses data sampling by the individual devices, where each of them has its own oscillator driving the local sampling process, resulting in slightly different sampling rates at the individual sensor nodes. Nevertheless, for certain downstream signal processing tasks it is important to compensate even for small sampling rate offsets. Aligning the sampling rates of oscillators which differ only by a few parts-per-million, is, however, challenging and quite different from traditional multirate signal processing tasks. In this paper we propose to transfer a precise but computationally demanding time domain approach, inspired by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to an efficient frequency domain implementation. To this end a buffer control is employed which compensates for sampling offsets which are multiples of the sampling period, while a digital filter, realized by the well-known Overlap-Save method, handles the fractional part of the sampling phase offset. With experiments on artificially misaligned data we investigate the parametrization, the efficiency, and the induced distortions of the proposed resampling method. It is shown that a favorable compromise between residual distortion and computational complexity is achieved, compared to other sampling rate offset compensation techniques.},

Similar to the ZC case, we propose a system of simultaneously constrained signed-CS problems to reconstruct a sparse signal from its Level Crossings (LC)s and modify both the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) and BSLO algorithms to solve this problem.

  pages = {1-5},
  abstract = {We propose a novel framework for reducing distant noise by using a distributed microphone array; reducing noise propagated from a far distance in real-time. Previous studies have revealed that a distributed microphone array with an instantaneous mixing assumption can effectively reduce noise when the target and noise sources are significantly far apart. However, in distant noise reduction, the target and noise sources are not usually instantaneously mixed because the reverberation-and propagation-time from the noise sources to a microphone is longer than the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) length. To express reverberation- and propagation-parameters, we introduce a multi-delay noise model that represents the reverberation-time as a convolution of the transfer-function-gains and the noise sources and the propagation-time as time-frame delays. These parameters are estimated on the basis of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed conventional methods in several performance measurements and could reduce distant noise propagated from more than 100 m away in a real-environment.},

  abstract = {We present a phase-sensitive speech enhancement algorithm based on a Kalman filter estimator that tracks speech and noise in the logarithmic Bark power spectral domain. With modulation-domain Kalman filtering, the algorithm tracks the speech spectral log-power using perceptually-motivated Bark bands. By combining STFT bins into Bark bands, the number of frequency components is reduced. The Kalman filter prediction step separately models the inter-frame relations of the speech and noise spectral log-powers and the Kalman filter update step models the nonlinear relations between the speech and noise spectral log-powers using the phase factor in Bark bands, which follows a sub-Gaussian distribution. The posterior mean of the speech spectral log-power is used to create an enhanced speech spectrum for signal reconstruction. The algorithm is evaluated in terms of speech quality and computational complexity with different algorithm configurations compared on various noise types. The algorithm implemented in Bark bands is compared to algorithms implemented in STFT bins and experimental results show that tracking speech in the log Bark power spectral domain, taking into account the temporal dynamics of each subband envelope, is beneficial. Regarding the computational complexity, the percentage decrease in the real-time factor is 44% when using Bark bands compared to when using STFT bins.},

  abstract = {The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is one of the most popular tensor-based analysis tools due to its usefulness in numerous fields of application. The Q-order CPD is parametrized by Q matrices also called factors which have to be recovered. The factors estimation is usually carried out by means of the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm. In the context of multi-modal big data analysis, i.e., large order (Q) and dimensions, the ALS algorithm has two main drawbacks. Firstly, its convergence is generally slow and may fail, in particular for large values of Q, and secondly it is highly time consuming. In this paper, it is proved that a Q-order CPD of rank-R is equivalent to a train of Q 3-order CPD(s) of rank-R. In other words, each tensor train (TT)-core admits a 3-order CPD of rank-R. Based on the structure of the TT-cores, a new dimensionality reduction and factor retrieval scheme is derived. The proposed method has a better robustness to noise with a smaller computational cost than the ALS algorithm.},

To that end, we analyzed two sets of sentences: In the first set, each sentence was spoken with explicitly different speaking rates (slow, normal, fast) with a neutral emotion. In the second set, each sentence was spoken with seven emotions with implicitly different speaking rates. For each spoken sentence, the mean value and the standard deviation of phone durations were related to those of the corresponding normal or neutral counterparts. We found that the normalized relative standard deviation (NRSD) did not solely depend on the speaking rate, but also on the emotion. Based on these findings, we analyzed the listening effort and the naturalness of synthetic utterances, where the mean and the standard deviation of phone durations were modified independently of each other. For fast speech, listening effort and naturalness improved significantly, when the standard deviation of phone durations was reduced less than the mean phone durations. These results can be applied to time-compression strategies for synthetic speech, voice morphing, and realistic synthesis of emotional speech.},

  abstract = {The phase retrieval from multi-frequency intensity (power) observations is considered. The object to be reconstructed is complex-valued. A novel algorithm is presented that accomplishes both the object phase (absolute phase) retrieval and denoising for Poissonian and Gaussian measurements. The algorithm is derived from the maximum likelihood formulation with Block Matching 3D (BM3D) sparsity priors. These priors result in two filtering: one in the complex domain for complex-valued multi-frequency object images and another one in the real domain for the object absolute phase. The algorithm is iterative with alternating projections between the object and measurement variables. The simulation experiments are produced for Fourier transform image formation and random phase modulations of the object, then observations are random object diffraction patterns. The simulation results demonstrate the success of the algorithm for reconstruction of the complex phase objects with the high-accuracy performance even for a high dynamic range of the absolute phase and very noisy data.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {807-811},
  abstract = {Linear beamformers are optimal, in a mean square (MS) sense, when the signal of interest (SOI) and observations are jointly Gaussian and circular. When the SOI and observations are zero-mean, jointly Gaussian and non-circular, optimal beamformers become widely linear (WL). They become non-linear with a structure depending on the unknown joint probability distribution of the SOI and observations when the latter are jointly non-Gaussian, assumption which is very common in radiocommunications. In this context, a third-order Volterra minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer has been introduced recently for the reception of a SOI, whose waveform is unknown, but whose steering vector is known, corrupted by non-Gaussian and potentially non-circular interference, omnipresent in practical situations. However its statistical performance has not yet been analyzed. The aim of this paper is twofold. We first introduce an equivalent generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure of this beamformer and then, we present an analytical performance analysis of the latter in the presence of one interference. This allows us to quantify the improvement of the performance with respect to the linear and WL MVDR beamformers.},

Since the temporal samples received by the URA could be written into a tensorial form, we introduce the multilinear projection for developing a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimator. In the noiseless condition, the multilinear projector is orthogonal to the steering matrix of the URA. Thus the proposed DOA estimator is designed to find minimal points of the inner product of the steering vector and the multilinear projector. Based on the multilinear algebraic framework, the proposed approach provides a better subspace estimate than that of the matrix-based subspace. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In recent years the world's biodiversity is declining on an unprecedented scale. Many species are endangered and remaining populations need to be protected. To overcome this agitating issue, biologist started to use remote camera devices for wildlife monitoring and estimation of remaining population sizes. Unfortunately, the huge amount of data makes the necessary manual analysis extremely tedious and highly cost intensive. In this paper we re-train and apply two state-of-the-art deep-learning based object detectors to localize and classify Serengeti animals in camera-trap images. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate both algorithms on a self-established dataset and show that the combination of the results of both detectors can enhance overall mean average precision. In contrast to previous work our approach is not only capable of classifying the main species in images but can also detect them and therefore count the number of individuals which is in fact an important information for biologists, ecologists, and wildlife epidemiologists.},

  pages = {2424-2428},
  abstract = {Speaker localization in real environments is a fundamental task for many audio signal processing applications. Many localization methods fail when the environment imposes challenging conditions, such as reverberation. Recently, a method for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of speakers in reverberant environments was developed, which utilizes spherical arrays. This method uses the direct-path dominance (DPD) test to select time-frequency bins that contain spatial information on the direct sound. In this work, it is shown that when the threshold of the DPD test is lowered to select more bins for the estimation process, it falsely identifies bins dominated by reverberant sound, reducing DOA estimation accuracy. In this paper, a new DPD test is developed, which evaluates the extent to which the measured plane-wave density can be represented by a single plane-wave. While being more computationally expensive than the original test, it is more robust to reverberation, and leads to an improved DOA estimation. The latter is demonstrated by simulations of a speaker in a reverberant room.},

The optimization problem is then formulated based on the geometry of the modulation constellations and is shown to be non-convex.

The proposed ROI encryption makes use of the independent tile concept of HEVC that splits the video frame into separable rectangular areas. Tiles are used to extract the ROI from the background and only the tiles forming the ROI are encrypted. The selective encryption is performed for a set of HEVC syntax elements in a format compliant with the HEVC standard. Thus, the bit-stream can be decoded with a standard HEVC decoder where a secret key is only needed for ROI decryption. In Inter coding, tiles independency is guaranteed by restricting the motion vectors to use only unencrypted tiles in the reference frames. The proposed solution is validated by integrating the encryption into the open-source Kvazaar HEVC encoder and the decryption into the open-source openHEVC decoder, respectively. The results show that this solution performs secure encryption of ROI in real time and with diminutive bitrate and complexity overheads.},

  abstract = {Regularization and Bayesian inference based methods have been successfully applied for linear inverse problems. In these methods, often simple Gaussian or Poisson models for the forward model errors have been considered. In this work, we use variable splitting for the errors to model different sources of errors and their possible non-stationarity or impulsive nature using Student-t or other heavy tailed distributions. Also, as a prior model, a sparsity enforcing hierarchical model of Infinite Gaussian Mixture model is introduced. With these prior models, we obtain a complete Bayesian inference framework which can efficiently be implemented for any linear inverse problem. Interestingly, many recent regularization-based algorithms such as Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as well as more classical Bayesian based methods such as Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) are obtained as particular cases. One advantage of the Bayesian approach is the possibility to estimate, jointly with the reconstruction, the hyper-parameters such as the regularization parameter, thus the capability of proposing unsupervised methods. Examples of implementation of the proposed method in different signal and image processing such as deconvolution in mass spectrometry, estimation of periodic components estimation in biological signals and computed tomography are mentioned and referenced.},

We consider a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channel where all users (whether cellular or devices) are equipped with N > 1 antennas, and the Base Station (BS) has M ≥ N antennas. Interference between D2D pairs, between D2D transmitters and the BS and between cellular users and D2D receivers is then managed by determining clusters of D2D pairs and cellular users with very low relative interference levels. Clusters are obtained after graph-coloring on a pairwise interference-leakage based matrix. Then, several Resource Blocks (RB) allocation algorithms are proposed, with various fairness levels. A final orthogonalization step using Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) may be added at the BS in order to further reduce interference. Simulation results show very large D2D data rates improvements, while cellular data rates degradation due to interference can be controlled.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for dereverberation and denosing in the monaural source separation problem. However, the performance of current state-of-the-art methods is limited, particularly when applied in highly reverberant room environments. In this paper, we propose an enhanced time-frequency (T-F) mask to improve the separation performance. The ideal enhanced mask (IEM) consists of the dereverberation mask (DM) and the ideal ratio mask (IRM). The DM is specifically applied to eliminate the reverberations in the speech mixture and the IRM helps in denoising. The IEEE and the TIMIT corpora with real room impulse responses (RIRs) and noise from the NOISEX dataset are used to generate speech mixtures for evaluations. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods specifically in highly reverberant and noisy room environments.},

Two hybrid approaches were proposed and their results are: “FD(Original image + LBP maps)” (97.12% and 63.80%) and “FD(Original image + LBP maps + STD)” (98.20% and 70.80%) for Brodatz and UIUC image databases, respectively.

  abstract = {In the context of linear discrete state-space (LDSS) models, we generalize a result lately introduced in the restricted case of invertible state matrices, namely that the linear minimum variance distortionless response (LMVDR) filter shares exactly the same recursion as the linear least mean squares (LLMS) filter, aka the Kalman filter (KF), except for the initialization. An immediate benefit is the introduction of LMVDR fixed-point and fixed-lag smoothers (and possibly other smoothers or predictors), which has not been possible so far. This result is particularly noteworthy given the fact that, although LMVDR estimators are sub-optimal in mean-squared error sense, they are infinite impulse response distortionless estimators which do not depend on the prior knowledge on the mean and covariance matrix of the initial state. Thus the LMVDR estimators may outperform the usual LLMS estimators in case of misspecification of the prior knowledge on the initial state. Seen from this perspective, we also show that the LMVDR filter can be regarded as a generalization of the information filter form of the KF. On another note, LMVDR estimators may also allow to derive unexpected results, as highlighted with the LMVDR fixed-point smoother.},

We compare these two methods with the well-known binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) method. More specifically, we measure the 50% speech reception threshold, and the localization error of all dominant point sources in three different acoustic scenes. The listening tests are divided into a parameter selection phase and a testing phase. The parameter selection phase is used to select the algorithms' parameters based on one acoustic scene. In the testing phase, the two methods are evaluated in two other acoustic scenes in order to examine their robustness. Both methods achieve significantly better intelligiblity compared to the unprocessed scene, and slightly worse intelligibility than the BMVDR method. However, unlike the BMVDR method which severely distorts the binaural cues of all interferers, the new methods achieve localization errors which are not significantly different compared to those of the unprocessed scene.},

This function estimates DOA for multiple speakers by calculation the cross-correlation between microphone signals but its accuracy decreases in adverse conditions. The aim of proposed method in this paper is localization of multiple simultaneous speakers in undesirable condition. The proposed method is based on novel 3D nested microphone array in combination with obtained information of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and subband processing. The proposed 3D nested microphone array prepares the condition for 3D localization and eliminates the spatial aliasing between microphone signals. Also, we propose the DWT for extraction the information of speech signal. Since, the spectral information of speech signal concentrates on low frequencies, we propose a structure of filter bank based on DWT to increase the frequency resolution on low frequencies. The performed evaluation on real and simulated data shows the superiority of our proposed method in comparison with Fullband and subband processing with uniform filters and uniform microphone array.},

  abstract = {To design faster and more energy-efficient systems, numerous inexact arithmetic operators have been proposed, generally obtained by modifying the logic structure of conventional circuits. However, as the quality of service of an application has to be ensured, these operators need to be precisely characterized to be usable in commercial or real-life applications. The characterization of inexact operators is commonly achieved with exhaustive or random bit-accurate gate-level simulations. However, for high word lengths, the time and memory required for such simulations become prohibitive. Besides, when simulating a random sample, no confidence information is given on the precision of the characterization. To overcome these limitations, CASSIS, a new characterization method for inexact operators is proposed. By exploiting statistical properties of the approximation error, the number of simulations needed for precise characterization is drastically reduced. From user-defined confidence requirements, the proposed method computes the minimal number of simulations to obtain the desired accuracy on the characterization. For 32-bit adders, the CASSIS method reduces the number of simulations needed up to a few tens of thousands points.},

  abstract = {Autoencoder, at the heart of a deep learning structure, plays an important role in extracting abstract representation of a set of input training patterns. Abstract representation contains informative features to demonstrate a large set of data patterns in an optimal way in certain applications. It is shown that through sparse regularization of outputs of the hidden units (codes) in an autoencoder, the quality of codes can be enhanced that leads to a higher learning performance in applications like classification. Almost all methods trying to achieve code sparsity in an autoencoder use a smooth approximation of l1 norm, as the best convex approximation of pseudo l0 norm. In this paper, we incorporate sparsity to autoencoder training optimization process using non-smooth convex l1 norm and propose an efficient algorithm to train the structure. The non-smooth l1 regularization have shown its efficiency in imposing sparsity in various applications including feature selection via lasso and sparse representation using basis pursuit. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show superiority of this term in training a sparse autoencoder over previously proposed ones. As a byproduct of the proposed method, it can also be used to apply different types of non-smooth regularizers to autoencoder training problem.},

We look for the best sampling scheme that maximizes the capacity of the sampled channel between the input signal and the M sampled outputs signals, where the channels are composed of all-pass linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with additive Gaussian white noise. For the case where the total rate is between M-1 and M times the Nyquist rate, the optimal scheme samples M-1 outputs at Nyquist rate and the last output at the remaining rate. When M = 2 the optimal performance can also be attained by an equally sampled scheme under some condition on the LTI systems. Surprisingly, equal sampling is suboptimal in general. Nevertheless, for some total sampling rates where there is an integer relation between the number of channels and the total rate, a uniform sampling achieves the optimal performance. Finally, we discuss the relation between maximizing the capacity and minimizing the mean-square error.},

  abstract = {Light fields have emerged as one of the most promising 3D representation formats, enabling a richer and more immersive representation of a visual scene. The lenslet light field acquisition approach consists in placing an array of micro-lenses between the camera main lens and the photosensor to allow capturing both the intensity and the direction of the light rays. This type of representation format offers new interaction possibilities with the visual content, notably a posteriori refocusing and visualization of different perspectives of the visual scene. However, this representation model is associated to very large amounts of data, thus requiring efficient coding solutions in order applications involving storage and transmission may be deployed. This paper proposes a novel lenslet light field imaging scalable coding solution adopting a wavelet-based approach, able to offer view, quality and spatial scalabilities, to meet the characteristics of multiple types of displays, transmission channels and user needs. The performance results show that the proposed coding solution performs better than alternative scalable coding solutions, notably JPEG 2000.},

  abstract = {In many real-world applications, ranging from predictive maintenance to personalized medicine, early classification of time series data is of paramount importance for supporting decision makers. In this article, we address this challenging task with a novel approach based on reinforcement learning. We introduce an early classifier agent, an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent (deep Q-network, DQN) [1] able to perform early classification in an efficient way. We formulate the early classification problem in a reinforcement learning framework: we introduce a suitable set of states and actions but we also define a specific reward function which aims at finding a compromise between earliness and classification accuracy. While most of the existing solutions do not explicitly take time into account in the final decision, this solution allows the user to set this trade-off in a more flexible way. In particular, we show experimentally on datasets from the UCR time series archive [2] that this agent is able to continually adapt its behavior without human intervention and progressively learn to compromise between accurate and fast predictions.},

  pages = {2350-2354},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method for embedding one-dimensional, periodic time-series data into higher-dimensional topological spaces to support robust recovery of signal features via topological data analysis under noisy sampling conditions. Our method can be considered an extension of the popular time delay embedding method to a larger class of linear operators. To provide evidence for the viability of this method, we analyze the simple case of sinusoidal data in three steps. First, we discuss some of the drawbacks of the time delay embedding framework in the context of periodic, sinusoidal data. Next, we show analytically that using the Hilbert transform as an alternative embedding function for sinusoidal data overcomes these drawbacks. Finally, we provide empirical evidence of the viability of the Hilbert transform as an embedding function when the parameters of the sinusoidal data vary over time.},

  abstract = {Energy constraint is always a bottleneck in a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN). Online censoring is an effective approach to reduce the overall power consumption by only transmitting statistical informative data. However, individual sensor may still suffer from energy shortage due to frequent transmission of informative data or geographical long distance transmission. In this paper, we consider the parameters estimation problem in WSNs, where the goal is to minimize the estimation error while keeping the network lifetime long. A distributed censoring algorithm is developed, which allows sensor nodes to make autonomous decisions on whether to transmit the sampled data. We show that with the proposed algorithm, the network lifetime extends and approaches to its theoretical limit, and the performance loss in terms of the estimation error is minimal. Simulation results validate its effectiveness.},

In the proposed method, to extract spatial information from distributed microphones while taking into account whether any pairs of microphones are synchronized and/or closely located, we derive a new cepstrum feature utilizing a graph-based basis transformation. Specifically, in the proposed graph-based cepstrum, the logarithm of the amplitude in a multichannel observation is converted to a feature vector by an inverse graph Fourier transform, which can consider whether any pair of microphones is connected. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed graph-based cepstrum effectively extracts spatial information with consideration of the microphone connections. Moreover, the results show that the proposed method more robustly classifies acoustic scenes than conventional spatial features when the observed sounds have a large synchronization mismatch between partially synchronized microphone groups.},

  abstract = {Admission control has been widely utilized to alleviate network congestion. However, most current studies choose the admissible users based on instantaneous channel information. Due to the time-varying characteristics of wireless channels, the admissible user set changes quickly, which complicates network management and renders heavy operational costs. This motivates us to take the stability of the admissible user set into account in admission control, thus leading to a long-term admission control problem. In this paper, we consider a joint long-term admission control and beamforming problem in a downlink network consisting of one multi-antenna base station (BS) and multiple single-antenna users. To maintain a relatively stable admissible user set and minimize the power cost for the admissible users to achieve their quality-of-service levels, we jointly optimize the admissible users, the BS transmit beamformers, and the switching frequency of each user's admissible status in a given time period. To handle this challenging non-convex problem, we first design a sequential convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to iteratively compute a stationary solution. To facilitate algorithm's implementation, we further employ the alternating direction method of multipliers to come up with an efficient, semi-closed-form update of each SCA problem.},

The pdf of the velocity is then the convolution of the phases pdfs. To confirm this, we measure several times the velocity in a flow phantom and compare the empirical histogram with the theoretical pdf. We also acquire the velocity from a volunteers aorta using a standard protocol for 4D Flow and multiple coils. Based on this noise characterization, we also propose an optimal weighing for combining multiple coils which is not based only on the coil sensitivities.},

The DAE provides good gain in performance when it has been trained using the noise present in the test utterances (“seen” conditions). However, if the noise present in the test utterance is different to what was used in the training of the DAE (“un-seen” conditions), then the performance degrades to a great extent. To improve the ASR performance in such unseen conditions, a model compensation technique, namely the Vector Taylor Series with Auditory Masking (VTS-AM) is used. We propose a new Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) based measure, which can reliably choose the type of compensation to be used for best performance gain.

This nonlinear model describes for example the response of a non-selective metal-oxide gas sensor (MOX) in presence of two gases such as acetone and ethanol diluted in an air buffer. In order to quantify the gas components, it is necessary to inverse the linear-quadratic model. In addition, we look for reducing the number of samples for the calibration step. Therefore, we here propose a Bayesian blind source separation method, with only few points of calibration and which is based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling methods to estimate the mean of the posterior distribution. We analyze the performance on a set of simulated samples. We use a cross-validation approach, with three steps: first, we blindly estimate the mixing coefficients and sources; second, we correct the scale factors thanks to few calibration samples; and third, we validate the method on validation samples, estimating sources thanks to mixing coefficients estimated before on the calibration samples. We compare this unsupervised nonlinear method with a supervised method to evaluate the performance with respect to the number of calibration points: with 10 calibration points instead of 160, the performance achieves 11 dB, with a loss limited to 1.5 dB.},

However, these schemes require a one-to-one connection between the RF chains and antennas. In this paper we propose a two-step broadband multiuser equalizer for hybrid sub-connected architectures, which is a more realistic approach for practical systems. The low-complexity user-terminals employ only analog precoders computed from the knowledge of the average angle of departure of each cluster, which is constant over the bandwidth. At the receiver side, we design a hybrid multi-user equalizer by minimizing the average bit-error-rate. A two-step approach is considered, where the analog part is constant over the iterations due to hardware constraints and the digital part is iterative. The analog part is also constant over all subcarriers while the digital part is computed on a per subcarrier basis. The proposed sub-connected based equalizer is compared with the fully connected counterpart. The results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is close to the fully connected one after just a few iterations performed at the digital domain.},

To this end, we exploit the analogy with feature fusion to propose a rigorous framework for the combination of TNs, with a particular focus on their summation as a natural way of their combination. The proposed framework is shown to allow for feature combination of any number of tensors, as long as their TN representation topologies are isomorphic.

  year = {2018},
  pages = {271-275},
  abstract = {In modern array processing or spectral analysis, mostly two different signal models are considered: the conditional signal model (CSM) and the unconditional signal model. The discussed signal models are Gaussian and the signal sources parameters are connected either with the expectation value in the conditional case or with the covariance matrix in the unconditional one. We focus on the CSM resulting from several observations of partially coherent signal sources whose amplitudes undergo a Gaussian random walk between observations. In the proposed generalized CSM, the signal sources parameters become connected with both the expectation value and the covariance matrix. Even though an analytical expression of the associated generalized conditional maximum likelihood estimators (GCM-LEs) can be easily exhibited, it does not allow computation of GCMLEs in the large sample regime. As a main contribution, we introduce a recursive form of the GCMLEs which allows their computation whatever the number of observations combined. This recursive form paves the way to assess the effect of partially coherent amplitudes on GCMLEs mean-squared error in the large sample regime. Interestingly, we exhibit non consistent GMLEs in the large sample regime.},

  abstract = {Image quality assessment plays an important role in iris recognition systems because the system performance is affected by low quality iris images. With the development of electronic color imaging, there are more and more researches about visible wavelength (VW) iris recognition. Compared to the near infrared iris images, using VW iris images acquired under unconstrained imaging conditions is a more challenging task for the iris recognition system. However, the number of quality assessment methods for VW iris images is limited. Therefore, it is interested to investigate whether existing no-reference image quality metrics (IQMs) which are designed for natural images can assess the quality of VW iris images. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of 15 selected no-reference IQMs on VW iris biometrics. The experimental results show that several IQMs can assess iris sample quality according to the system performance.},

This analysis demonstrates in particular that: (i) when considering the finite alphabet nature of communication signals, it is possible to efficiently solve the pilot contamination problem with semi-blind channel estimation approach; and (ii) the Second Order Statistics (SOS) only are not sufficient to address the full channel identifiability even if the semi-blind approach is considered.},

To do so, we develop data augmentation approaches to reflect the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of hypo and hyper-articulated speech.

A series of speech recognition tests are conducted across various speech styles. The results show that we are able to achieve meaningful performance gain by using our approaches.

The real-time testing results have shown that the proposed algorithm with the trained model parameters can not only achieve the optimum detection performance in all various noisy conditions but also reject all kinds of interferences including undesired voice and other unrelated transient-sounds. In comparison with the existing algorithms, the proposed detection algorithm significantly improves the false negative and false positive performance.

Reliably recording cognitive activity, which is in this range, is impossible without removing or reducing the effect of muscle contamination. Our unique database of paralysed conscious subjects enabled us to test the effect of combining beamforming and blind source separation in reducing tonic muscle contamination of scalp electrical recordings. Using the beamforming technique, muscle sources are separated automatically based on their location; while using blind source separation, muscle components are separated based on their spectral gradient. Our results show that applying the beamforming technique on data pruned by a blind source separation technique (or vice versa) can reduce tonic muscle contamination significantly more than applying either of them separately, especially at peripheral locations. Hence, these approaches complement each other in reducing muscle contamination of EEG.},

  abstract = {The Hit-or-Miss Transform (HMT) is a powerful morphological operation that can be utilised in many digital image analysis problems. Its original binary definition and its extension to grey-level images have seen it applied to various template matching and object detection tasks. However, further extending the transform to incorporate colour or multivariate images is problematic since there is no general or intuitive way of ordering data which allows the formal definition of morphological operations in the traditional manner. In this paper, instead of following the usual strategy for Mathematical Morphology, based on the definition of a total order in the colour space, we propose a transform that relies on a colour or multivariate distance measure. As with the traditional HMT operator, our proposed transform uses two structuring elements (SE) - one for the foreground and one for the background - and retains the idea that a good fitting is obtained when the foreground SE is a close match to the image and the background SE matches the image complement. This allows for both flat and non-flat structuring elements to be used in object detection. Furthermore, the use of ranking operations on the computed distances allows the operator to be robust to noise and partial occlusion of objects.},

  abstract = {Factor graphs provide a convenient framework for automatically generating (approximate) Bayesian inference algorithms based on message passing. Examples include the sum-product algorithm (belief propagation), expectation maximization (EM), expectation propagation (EP) and variational message passing (VMP). While these message passing algorithms can be generated automatically, they depend on a library of precomputed message update rules. As a result, the applicability of the factor graph approach depends on the availability of such rules for all involved nodes. This paper describes the probit factor node for linking continuous and binary random variables in a factor graph. We derive (approximate) sum-product message update rules for this node through constrained moment matching, which leads to a robust version of the EP algorithm in which all messages are guaranteed to be proper. This enables automatic Bayesian inference in probabilistic models that involve both continuous and discrete latent variables, without the need for model-specific derivations. The usefulness of the node as a factor graph building block is demonstrated by applying it to perform Bayesian inference in a linear classification model with corrupted class labels.},

This work proposes an end-to-end architecture to offer biometric authentication using PPG biosensors through Convolutional Networks. We provide an evaluation of the performance of our approach in two different databases: Troika and PulseID, the latter a publicly available database specifically collected by the authors for such a purpose. Our verification approach through convolutional network based models and using raw PPG signals appears to be viable in current monitoring procedures within e-health and fitness environments showing a remarkable potential as a biometry. The approach tested on a verification fashion, on trials lasting one second, achieved an AUC of 78.2% and 83.2%, averaged among target subjects, on PulseID and Troika datasets respectively. Our experimental results on previous small datasets support the usefulness of PPG extracted biomarkers as viable traits for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics. Furthermore, the approach results in a low input throughput and complexity that allows for a continuous authentication in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, the reported experiments also suggest that further research is necessary to account for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects.},

  abstract = {Multifractal analysis is a reference tool for the analysis of data based on local regularity, which has been proven useful in an increasing number of applications. However, in its current formulation, it remains a fundamentally univariate tool, while being confronted with multivariate data in an increasing number of applications. Recent contributions have explored a first multivariate theoretical grounding for multi fractal analysis and shown that it can be effective in capturing and quantifying transient higher-order dependence beyond correlation. Building on these first fundamental contributions, this work proposes and studies the use of a quadratic model for the joint multi fractal spectrum of bivariate time series. We obtain expressions for the Pearson correlation in terms of the random walk and a multifractal cascade dependence parameters under this model, provide complete expressions for the multifractal parameters and propose a transformation of these parameters into natural coordinates that allows to effectively summarize the information they convey. Finally, we propose estimators for these parameters and assess their statistical performance through numerical simulations. The results indicate that the bivariate multi fractal parameter estimates are accurate and effective in quantifying non-linear, higher-order dependencies between time series.},

To date, their characterization remain limited to univariate analysis. Independently, functional connectivity analysis usually entails uncovering interactions between remote brain regions. In MEG, specific indices (e.g., Imaginary coherence ICOH and weighted Phase Lag Index wPLI) were developed to quantify phase synchronization between time series reflecting activities of distant brain regions and applied to oscillatory regimes (e.g., α -band in (8, 12) Hz). No such indices has yet been developed for scale-free brain dynamics. Here, we propose to design new indices (w-ICOH and w-wPLI) based on complex wavelet analysis, dedicated to assess functional connectivity in the scale- free regime. Using synthetic multivariate scale-free data, we illustrate the potential and efficiency of these new indices to assess phase coupling in the scale-free dynamics range. From MEG data (36 individuals), we demonstrate that w-wPLI constitutes a highly sensitive index to capture significant and meaningful group-level changes of phase couplings in the scale-free (0.1, 1.5) Hz regime between rest and task conditions.},

  abstract = {Addressing dependent data as independent has become usual for Parkinson's Disease (PD) detection by using features extracted from replicated voice recordings. A binary regression model with an Asymmetric Student t (AST) distribution as link function has been developed in a classification context by taking into account the within-subject dependence. This opens the possibility of handling situations in which the probabilities of the binary response approach 0 and 1 at different rates. The computational issue has been addressed by proposing and using a representation based on a mixture of normal distributions for the AST distribution. This allows to include latent variables to derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm that is used to generate samples from the posterior distribution. The applicability of the proposed approach has been tested with a simulation-based experiment and has been applied to a real dataset for PD detection.},

  abstract = {This work develops a fully decentralized variance-reduced learning algorithm for multi-agent networks where nodes store and process the data locally and are only allowed to communicate with their immediate neighbors. In the proposed algorithm, there is no need for a central or master unit while the objective is to enable the dispersed nodes to learn the exact global model despite their limited localized interactions. The resulting algorithm is shown to have low memory requirement, guaranteed linear convergence, robustness to failure of links or nodes and scalability to the network size. Moreover, the decentralized nature of the solution makes large-scale machine learning problems more tractable and also scalable since data is stored and processed locally at the nodes.},

  pages = {2454-2458},
  abstract = {The celebrated filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm does not work well for active noise control (ANC) of impulsive source. In previous attempts, the robustness of FxLMS algorithm has been improved by thresholding the reference and/or error signals used in the ANC system. However, estimating these thresholds is not any easy task in most of the practical scenarios. The need for appropriate thresholds is avoided in a previously proposed improved normalized-step-size FxLMS (INSS-FxLMS) algorithm, however, there is a tradeoff situation between the convergence speed and steady-state performance as a fixed step-size needs to be selected properly. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for impulsive ANC (IANC) systems. The proposed algorithm is based on the previously proposed INSS-FxLMS. The main idea to employ a convex-combined step-size which automatically converges to a large value to improve the convergence speed during the transient state, and to a small value as the IANC system converges at the steady-state. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Towards this goal, the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture offers mobile operators a flexible and dynamic framework for managing resources and processing data. This paper proposes a dynamic allocation approach for processing resources in a C- RAN supported by the concept of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). To achieve this objective, we virtualised the Baseband Unit (BBU) resources for Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile network into a BBU pool supported by Linux Container (LXC) technology. We report on experiments conducted in the Iris testbed with high-definition video streaming by implementing Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based LTE functionality with the virtualised BBU pool.

In this paper we present a framework for view synthesis when the user requests an arbitrary viewpoint that is closer to the 3D scene than the reference image. The requested view constructed via depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) on the target image plane has missing information due to the expansion of objects and disoccluded areas. Building on our previous work on expansion hole filling, we propose a novel method that adopts a graph-based representation of the target view in order to inpaint the disocclusion holes under sparsity priors. Experimental results indicate that the reconstructed views have PSNR and SSIM quality values that are comparable to those of the state of the art inpainting methods. Visual results show that we are able to preserve details better without introducing blur and reduce artifacts on boundaries between objects on different layers.},

  abstract = {Free licensed spectral bands have become rare due to the increasing number of wireless users and their demand for high data rates. Likewise, the static allocation of these bands results in an under-utilization of the spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged as a promising solution to the dilemma by allowing opportunistic users to transmit in the absence of licensed users. Spectrum sensing is therefore the key component of CR and coexistence management in general. In order to detect as much transmission opportunities as possible, a large bandwidth has to be monitored which according to Shannon-Nyquist necessitates high sampling rates. For fast and accurate spectrum estimation, we propose a novel approach called Compressed Edge Spectrum Sensing (CESS) which exploits the sparsity of power spectrum edges and allows for sampling down to 6% of Nyquist without losses in the detection accuracy of occupied and unoccupied spectrum regions.},

One of the main drawbacks of the classical Doppler processing approach concerns the suppression of small and slowly-moving targets when rejecting ground clutter returns. In order to address this problem a two-step Doppler method is proposed in this paper. The first step uses a new iterative algorithm that resolves ambiguities and detects fast (exo-clutter) targets. The detection of slow (endo-clutter) targets is then performed by an adaptive detection scheme that uses a new covariance matrix estimation technique. Pulse trains with different characteristics are then associated for enhanced detection performance.},

  abstract = {The problems of echo and noise contaminating a desired talker signal in a communication or an entertainment device are considered. In the following, we propose a combined method comprising a linear echo-canceller followed by a weighted minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer designed to reduce noise and echo residues. For the echo-canceller stage we use a fast-converging multichannel Q R decomposition (QRD)-recursive least squares (RLS) method. For the beamformer stage, we adopt and modify our recently proposed method of a fast-tracking QRD based MVDR beamformer [1]. We model that the residual echo is dominated by non-linearly distorted components which undergo the same echo paths as the non-distorted component. Thereby, the MVDR beamformer is designed to minimize a weighted sum of the powers of the noise and of the non-linear echo while maintaining the desired talker undistorted. The computational and memory complexities of the proposed algorithm are sufficiently low, making it appropriate for implementation in mobile devices. The performance of the proposed method is tested using real recordings from two commercial devices, a mobile-phone and a smart-speaker.},

Nonlinear CS reconstruction usually relies on analysis (e.g., Total Variation) or synthesis (e.g., wavelet) based priors and ℓ1 regularization to promote sparsity in the transform domain. Here, we compare the performance of several orthogonal wavelet transforms with those of tight frames for MR image reconstruction in the CS setting combined with parallel imaging (multiple receiver coil). We show that overcomplete dictionaries such as the fast curvelet transform provide improved image quality as compared to orthogonal transforms. For doing so, we rely on an analysis-based formulation where the underlying ℓ1 regularized criterion is minimized using a primal dual splitting method (e.g., Condat-Vũ algorithm). Validation is performed on ex-vivo baboon brain T2* MRI data collected at 7 Tesla and restrospectively under-sampled using non-Cartesian schemes (radial and Sparkling). We show that multiscale analysis priors based on tight frames instead of orthogonal transforms achieve better image quality (pSNR, SSIM) in particular at low signal-to-noise ratio.},

In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic reverberation model, that permits us to retrieve all these well-known results within a common mathematical framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a unification work is presented. The benefits are multiple: several new formulas generalizing the classical results are established, that jointly characterize the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of late reverberation.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient channel estimation algorithm for millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with a hybrid analog-digital multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture and few-bits quantization at the receiver. The sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel is exploited for the problem formulation while limited resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used in the receiver architecture. The estimation problem can be tackled using compressed sensing through the Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) based parametric denoiser with the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) framework. Expectation-maximization (EM) density estimation is used to avoid the need of specifying channel statistics resulting the EM-SURE-GAMP algorithm to estimate the channel. SURE, depending on the noisy observation, is minimized to adaptively optimize the denoiser within the parametric class at each iteration. The proposed solution is compared with the expectation-maximization generalized AMP (EM-GAMP) solution and the mean square error (MSE) performs better with respect to low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, the number of ADC bits, and the training length. The use of the low resolution ADCs reduces power consumption and leads to an efficient mmWave MIMO system.},

  abstract = {Real-time detection of cycle-slips on undifferenced carrier-phase measurements is an important task to properly exclude wrong phase trackers from precise positioning algorithms. The detection is especially challenging in high-dynamic mobile scenarios, where traditional approaches (as those based on single-channel polynomial fitting) may easily lead to false positives. Using a multi-channel formulation of the problem, the proposed technique takes benefit of the available data redundancy (high number of tracked satellites) in order to ameliorate the false positives. This robustness is accomplished by adaptively estimating the orthogonal subspace spanned by the polynomial time-varying residuals obtained from all available channels (treated as a vector process), and using that subspace to form efficient channel combinations with cancelled satellite-receiver dynamics. The main advantage of the multi-channel approach is that wrong measurements can be discarded without needing any positioning estimate nor phase-ambiguity solver, thus improving the accuracy, reliability and integrity of positioning. The performance improvement is shown by means of theoretical analysis and computer simulations.},

  abstract = {The conjugate gradient (CG) adaptive filtering algorithm is an alternative to the more widely used Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithms, where the former requires more computations, and the latter leads to slower convergence. In recent years, some adaptive filtering algorithms have been equipped with data selection mechanism to classify if the data currently available consists of an outlier or if it brings about enough innovation. In both cases the data could be discarded avoiding extra computation and performance degradation. This paper proposes a data selection strategy to the CG algorithm and verifies its effectiveness in simulations utilizing synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging field of brain study. From an engineering perspective, the absence of a ground truth signal or a model for producing synthetic data has hindered understanding of the underlying elements of this signal and validating of existing algorithms. In this paper, a dynamic model of artificial NIRS signal is proposed. The model incorporates arterial pulsations, its possible frequency drifts, Mayer waves, respiratory waves and other very low frequency components. Parameter selection and model fitting has been carried out using measurements from a NIRS database. To be general in the process of parameter selection, our dataset included 4 NIRS devices and 256 channels for each subject, covering all the scalp and therefore providing realistic measures of the varying parameters. Results are compared with the real data in time and frequency domains, both showing high level of resemblance.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {2265-2269},
  abstract = {Spoken language identification is the process by which the language in a spoken utterance is recognized automatically. Spoken language identification is commonly used in speech translation systems, in multi-lingual speech recognition, and in speaker diarization. In the current paper, spoken language identification based on deep learning (DL) and the i-vector paradigm is presented. Specifically, a comparative study is reported, consisting of experiments on language identification using deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Also, the integration of the two methods into a complete system is investigated. Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of using DNN in spoken language identification. However, to date, the integration of CNN and i-vectors in language identification has not been investigated. The main advantage of using CNN is that fewer parameters are required compared to DNN. As a result, CNN is cheaper in terms of memory and the computational power needed. The proposed methods are evaluated on the NIST 2015 i-vector Machine Learning Challenge task for the recognition of 50 in-set languages. Using DNN, a 3.55% equal error rate (EER) was achieved. The EER when using CNN was 3.48%. When DNN and CNN systems were fused, an EER of 3.3% was obtained. The results are very promising, and they also show the effectiveness of using CNN and i-vectors in spoken language identification. The proposed methods are compared to a baseline method based on support vector machines (SVM) and they demonstrated significantly superior performance.},

  abstract = {Sparse phase retrieval (PR) aims at reconstructing a sparse signal vector from a few phaseless linear measurements. It emerges naturally in diverse applications, but it is NP-hard in general. Drawing from advances in nonconvex optimization, this paper presents a new algorithm that is termed compressive reweighted amplitude flow (CRAF) for sparse PR. CRAF operates in two stages: Stage one computes an initial guess by means of a new spectral procedure, and stage two implements a few hard thresholding based iteratively reweighted gradient iterations on the amplitude-based least-squares cost. When there are sufficient measurements, CRAF reconstructs the true signal vector exactly under suitable conditions. Furthermore, its sample complexity coincides with that of the state-of-the-art approaches. Numerical experiments showcase improved performance of the proposed approach relative to existing alternatives.},

  abstract = {User cooperation enabled traffic offloading has been shown to be a promising concept to serve a large number of mobile stations in the uplink of an urban traffic hotspot scenario. Multiple mobile stations form a virtual antenna array and jointly access the nearby WLAN access points, achieving large gains compared to non-cooperating schemes. In this paper we consider the corresponding downlink, where the non-cooperating WLAN access points individually transmit their signals to the mobile stations in the hotspot. In order to decode these signals, each mobile station then quantizes its received signal and broadcasts it to the other cooperating mobile stations. The channel access times allocated to the cooperating mobile stations in the broadcasting phase thereby strongly impact the quantization rates and eventually the system performance. Hence, these resources have to be assigned carefully, leading to a non-convex optimization problem. In this context, we propose an efficient resource allocation scheme which yields promising results at low computational complexity. Applying this scheme we then evaluate the downlink of user cooperation enable traffic offloading in an urban traffic hotspot scenario.},

The proposed system uses a vibrator that energizes the object and an accelerometer that monitors vibration propagation through the object during the handover. We focused on the machine-learning technique to classify between four states during object handover. A neural network was trained for these four states and tested online. In experimental trials an accuracy of 85.2 % and 93.9% were obtained respectively for four classes and two classes of actions by a neural network classifier.},

In this work, we study the problem of efficient estimation of missing hyperspectral measurements and we evaluate the impact of the reconstruction quality on the subsequent task of classification. We explore two cutting edge techniques for undersampled signal recovery, namely matrix and tensor completion, and we evaluate their performance on hyperspectral data recovery. Furthermore, we quantify the effects of the reconstruction error on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms via metrics such as classification accuracy and F1-score. The results demonstrate that robust and efficient classification is feasible, even from a substantially reduced number of measurements being available, especially when emerging deep learning approaches are adopted. Moreover, significant gains are obtained when exploring higher order structural information via tensor modelling, as compared to low order matrix-based methods.},

The results show relevant differences when varying the initial feature set but high stability when changing the regularization approach. The three considered methods have achieved very promising classification accuracy rates via 10-fold cross-validation analysis, reaching 88.5 %.},

Various techniques have been developed to detect rebroadcast attacks. These forensic analyses, however, face new threats from sophisticated machine learning techniques that are designed to modify images to circumvent detection. We describe a framework to analyze the resilience of rebroadcast detection to adversarial attacks. We describe the impact of repeated attacks and defenses on the efficacy of detecting rebroadcast content.

Such devices are critical for early detection of emergency conditions of people at risk and offer a wide range of medical facilities and services. Despite continuous advances in the field of wearable and implantable medical devices, it still faces major challenges such as energy-efficient and low-latency reconstruction of signals. This work presents a power-efficient real-time system for recovering neural signals. Such systems are of high interest for implantable medical devices, where reconstruction of neural signals needs to be done in realtime with low energy consumption. We combine a deep network and DCT-Iearning based compressive sensing framework to propose a novel and efficient compression-decompression system for neural signals. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods and show that it achieves superior reconstruction performance with significantly less computing time.},

In this paper the shearlet-based loop filter is proposed using a sparsifying transform, the shearlet transform, which can identify the important structures of natural images such as edges in the sparse transform domain. This allows for separating efficiently the important information from noise components. Our novel approach for in-loop filtering is to apply a shearlet transform to the decoded image, separating important structures from noise and perform an inverse shearlet transform combined with Wiener filtering. This effectively removes compression artefacts due to quantization noise and keeps the important features of the original image. Simulation results show that our shearlet based loop filter can improve the state-of-the-art video coding standard HEVC through up to 10.5% bit rate reduction along with improved subjective visual quality.},

We develop a new statistical framework which incorporates these aspects and then derive the joint localization and clock offset Maximum Likelihood Estimator to jointly estimate the location of the target and the clock offset.

Essentially, this type of approach decouples the frequency selective MIMO channel into a number of independent, frequency selective, single-input single-output (SISO) sub-channels by way of a polynomial singular-value decomposition (PSVD) or polynomial QR decomposition (PQRD) with successive interference cancellation. In this paper, we investigate a new PQRD algorithm, namely SM-PQRD, which is based on the concept of recently developed sequential matrix diagonalization (SMD). We also propose a new variant of SM-PQRD, namely MESM-PQRD to minimize computational complexity. Simulation results show that the new PQRD converges faster than state of the art algorithms. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for a frequency selective MIMO channel equalization problem.},

  abstract = {Though high resolution time-frequency representations (TFRs) are developed and provide satisfactory results for multicomponent nonstationary signals, extracting multiple ridges from the time-frequency (TF) plot to approximate the instantaneous frequencies (IFs) for intersected components is quite difficult. In this work, the sparse time-frequency-frequency-rate representation (STFFRR) is proposed by using the short-time sparse representation (STSR) with the chirp dictionary. The instantaneous frequency rate (IFRs) and IFs of signal components can be jointly estimated via the STFFRR. As there are permutations between the IF and IFR estimates of signal components at different instants, the local k-means clustering algorithm is applied for component linking. By employing the STFFRR, the intersected components in TF plot can be well separated and robust IF estimation can be obtained. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The issue of convolutive blind source separation (BSS) is addressed in this paper. Independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), unifying frequency-domain independent component analysis (FDICA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), is a method that has recently proposed to model low-rank structure of source spectra by using NMF in addition to independence between sources used in FDICA and independent vector analysis (IVA). Although ILRMA has been shown to provide better separation performance than FDICA and IVA, the frequency components of each source are assumed to be independent in ILRMA due to NMF modeling of source spectra, which may degrade its performance when the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) is unable to decorrelate the frequency components for each source. This paper therefore presents a new BSS method that unifies IVA and positive semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF). PSDTF models not only power spectra in the same way NMF does but also models the correlations between frequency bins in each source. The proposed method can be viewed as a multichannel extension of PSDTF and exploits both the independence between sources and the inter-frequency correlations as a clue for separating mixtures. Experimental results indicate the improved performance of our approach.},

A smooth graph which effectively captures the relational structure of the azimuth values is constructed using the estimated phase angle. By visualizing the actual azimuth available at the reliable depth points (corresponding to the feature-rich region) as sampled graph signal, the azimuth at the remaining feature-limited region is estimated. Unlike the existing ambiguity resolution scheme in PMS which resolves only the π/2-ambiguity, the proposed approach resolves both the π and π/2-ambiguity. Simulation results are presented, which shows that in addition to resolving both the ambiguities, the proposed GSP based method performs significantly better in resolving the π/2-ambiguity than the existing approach.},

The distorted born iterative method (DBIM) is one of the most effective approaches to reconstruct dielectric map and recognize a high contrast object. However, in an actual NDT observation model, it must be assumed that only reflection field is available, which makes the ill-posed problem extremely difficult. To solve this problem, the range points migration (RPM) based object area extraction scheme is incorporated into the DBIM, where the area of region of interest (ROI) is considerably downsized to reduce the number of unknowns in the DBIM. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) based numerical simulation tests demonstrate that our proposed method effectively enhance the accuracy of dielectric map reconstruction for the sparsely distributed object model.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the light field sampling produced by ideal plenoptic sensors, an emerging technology providing new optical capabilities. In particular, we leverage its potential with a new optical design that couples a pyramid lens with an ideal plenoptic sensor. The main advantage is that it extends the field-of-view (FOV) of a main-lens without changing its focal length. To evince the utility of the proposed design we have performed different experiments. First, we demonstrate on simulated synthetic images that our optical design effectively doubles the FOV. Then, we show its feasibility with two different prototypes using plenoptic cameras on the market with very different plenoptic samplings, namely a Raytrix R5 and a Canon 5D MarkIV. Arguably, future cameras with ideal plenoptic sensors will be able to be coupled with pyramid lenses to extend its inherent FOV in a single snapshot.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is considered as one of the promising technology to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of fifth generation (5G) networks. In this paper, we analyze the performance of uplink massive MIMO systems over a Rician fading channel and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at a base station (BS). Major Rician fading channel parameters including path-loss, shadowing and multipath fading are considered. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) based channel estimation is done at the BS. Assuming a zero-forcing (ZF) detector, a closed-form expression for the uplink achievable rate is derived and expressed as a function of system and propagation parameters. The impact of the system and propagation parameters on the achievable rate are investigated. Numerical results show that, when the Rician K-factor grows, the uplink achievable sum rate improves. Specifically, when both the number of BS antenna and the Rician K-factor become very large, channel estimation becomes more robust and the interference can be average out and thus, uplink sum rate improves sianificantlv.},

Solar energy, produced by large solar farms, is a fast growing technology offering environmental friendly power supply. However, its efficiency suffers from solar cell defects occurring during the operation life or caused by environmental incidents. These defects can be made visible using electroluminescence (EL) imaging. A manual classification of these EL images is very time and cost demanding and prone to subjective inter-examiner variations. For a fully automated defect detection, we introduce a deep learning based classification pipeline operating on the EL images. This includes image preprocessing for distortion correction, segmentation and perspective correction as well as a deep convolutional neural network for solar defect classification with special emphasis on dealing with highly imbalanced dataset. The impact of minority oversampling and data augmentation on the system accuracy is investigated.

To this end, a simple sensing mechanism is proposed, which does not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) to hold near the sparsity level, whilst it provides additional degrees of freedom to better capture and suppress the inherent sampling noise effects. In particular, a reduced set of MMVs is generated by projecting the source signals onto random vectors drawn from isotropic multivariate stable laws. Then, the correlated sparse signals are recovered from the random MMVs by means of a recently introduced sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. Experimental evaluations on synthetic data with varying number of sources, correlation values, and noise strengths, reveal the superiority of our proposed sensing mechanism, when compared against well-established RIP-based compressive sensing schemes.},

In this paper, a new approach to beam shape calibration, i.e., the calibration of direction dependent instrumental gains, is presented, in which the fact that these observations are done simultaneously is adequately exploited. It follows from imposing a novel spatial constraint on the direction dependent instrumental gain model. It may provide better calibration performance and may even allow beam shape calibration in scenarios in which the observations with the individual beams provide insufficient information to do so when they are treated as separate observations.},

Usually the constructive interference is exploited in the spatial dimension (multi-user interference), however in this work we consider a spatio-temporal precoding model which allows to exploit the interference also in the temporal dimension (inter-symbol interference). The proposed method, which optimizes the overs ampled transmit waveforms by minimizing the per-antenna transmit power, allows faster-than-Nyquist signaling over multi-user MISO systems without imposing additional complexity at the user terminals. The optimization is performed in a sequential fashion, by splitting the data streams in blocks and handling the inter-block interference. Numerical results are presented to assess the gains of the scheme in terms of effective rate and energy efficiency.},

We use multiple sequence alignment to construct directed acyclic graph representations of the database image sequences, where sequences of images of the same place acquired at different times are represented as alternative paths in a graph. We then use the POKer to compute the pairwise similarities between these graphs and the query image sequences obtained in a subsequent traversal of the environment, and match the corresponding locations. We evaluated our approach on a dataset which features extreme appearance variations due to seasonal changes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where it achieves higher precision and recall than two state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Small scale fading makes the wireless channel gain vary significantly over small distances and in the context of classical communication systems it can be detrimental to performance. But in the context of mobile robot (MR) wireless communications, we can take advantage of the fading using a mobility diversity algorithm (MDA) to deliberately locate the MR at a point where the channel gain is high. There are two classes of MDAs. In the first class, the MR explores various points, stops at each one to collect channel measurements and then locates the best position to establish communications. In the second class the MR moves, without stopping, along a continuous path while collecting channel measurements and then stops at the end of the path. It determines the best point to establish communications. Until now, the shape of the continuous path for such MDAs has been arbitrarily selected and currently there is no method to optimize it. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize such a path. Simulation results show that such optimized paths provide the MDAs with an increased performance, enabling them to experience higher channel gains while using less mechanical energy for the MR motion.},

Restoration by missing sample estimation based on conventional linear prediction has been extensively researched and used; however, it is hampered by the limitations of the linear prediction model. Recently, it has been shown that high-order sparse linear prediction offers better representation of music and voiced speech over conventional linear prediction. In this paper, the use of high-order sparse linear prediction for missing sample estimation of click degraded audio signals is proposed. The paper also explores a possible computational time saving by combining the high-order sparse linear prediction coefficient determination and filtering operations.

  pages = {1657-1661},
  abstract = {This paper describes a versatile tensor factorization technique called independent low-rank tensor analysis (ILRTA) and its application to single-channel audio source separation. In general, audio source separation has been conducted in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain under an unrealistic but conventional assumption of the independence of time-frequency (TF) bins. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a typical technique of single-channel source separation based on the low-rankness of source spectrograms. In a multichannel setting, independent component analysis (ICA) and its multivariate extension called independent vector analysis (IVA) have often been used for blind source separation based on the independence of source spectrograms. Integrating NMF and IVA, independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) was recently proposed. To deal with the covariance of TF bins, in this paper we propose ILRTA as a new extension of NMF. Both ILRMA and ILRTA aim to find independent and low-rank sources. A key difference is that while ILRMA estimates demixing filters that decorrelate the channels for multichannel source separation, ILRTA finds optimal transforms that decorrelate the time frames and frequency bins of a STFT representation for single-channel source separation in a way that the bin-wise independence assumed by NMF holds true as much as possible. We report evaluation results of ILRTA and discuss extension of ILRTA to multichannel source separation.},

With the aid of tools from stochastic geometry, we introduce a new closed-form analytical expression of the potential spectral efficiency. Unlike currently available analytical frameworks, the proposed analytical formulation explicitly depends on the transmit power and density of the base stations. This is obtained by generalizing the definition of coverage probability and by taking into account the sensitivity of the receiver not only during the detection of information data, but during the cell association phase as well. Based on the new analytical representation of the potential spectral efficiency, the energy efficiency is formulated in a tractable closed-form expression. The resulting optimization problem is studied and it is mathematically proved that the energy efficiency is a unimodal and strictly pseudo-concave function in the transmit power. Numerical results are illustrated and discussed.},

To maximize the lifetime of the WSN, the MR is deployed to act as an adaptive relay between a subset of the CHs and the FC. To achieve this we develop a multiple-link mobility diversity algorithm (MDA) executed by the MR that will allow to compensate simultaneously for the small-scale fading at the established wireless links (i.e., the MR-to-FC as well as various CH-to-MR communication links). Simulation results show that the proposed MR aided technique is able to significantly reduce the transmission power required and thus extend the operational lifetime of the WSN. We also show how the effect of small-scale fading at various wireless links is mitigated by using the proposed multiple -link MDA executed by a MR equipped with a single antenna.},

  abstract = {Separation of underdetermined speech mixtures, where the number of speakers is greater than the number of microphones, is a challenging task. Due to the intermittent behaviour of human conversations, typically, the instantaneous number of active speakers does not exceed the number of microphones, namely the mixture is locally (over-)determined. This scenario is addressed in this paper using a dual stage approach: diarization followed by separation. The diarization stage is based on spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix between different time frames. Specifically, the spectral gap reveals the overall number of speakers, and the computed eigenvectors form a simplex of the activity of the speakers across time. In the separation stage, the diarization results are utilized for estimating the mixing acoustic channels, as well as for constructing an unmixing scheme for extracting the individual speakers. The performance is demonstrated in a challenging scenario with six speakers and only four microphones. The proposed method shows perfect recovery of the overall number of speakers, close to perfect diarization accuracy, and high separation capabilities in various reverberation conditions.},

  abstract = {Blind beamforming constitutes a unified framework for the solution of two very important problems in seismological applications involving ensembles of similar signals, namely the signal alignment and signal enhancement problems. The former problem translates into the estimation of the time delays that exist between the signals, while the second problem deals with the optimal weighting of the signals, so that the SNR of their weighted average is maximized. A global optimization technique for the solution of the alignment problem with a sample-level accuracy, is proposed in this manuscript. The sample-level alignment problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and an approximate solution is proposed by using the technique of SDP relaxation. Finally, the signal enhancement problem is formulated as a quadratic maximization problem which in the vast majority of cases has an analytical solution, while in more challenging conditions can be approximately solved via SDP relaxation. The superior performance of the technique compared to other similar approaches is demonstrated through a number experiments involving numerical simulations with several signal and noise models.},

In particular, we study how many users that could be simultaneously spatially multiplexed and how much the range can be increased by deploying massive base station arrays. We also investigate how the devices can scale down their uplink power as the number of antennas grows with retained rates. We consider the uplink and utilize upper and lower bounds on known achievable rate expressions to study the effects of the massive arrays. We conduct a case study where we use simulations in the settings of existing IoT systems to draw realistic conclusions. We find that the gains which ultra narrowband systems get from utilizing massive MIMO are limited by the bandwidth and therefore those systems will not be able to spatially multiplex any significant number of users. We also conclude that the power scaling is highly dependent on the nominal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the single-antenna case.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of sparse beamforming for interference mitigation in milimiter wave (mm Wave) frequency bands. Multiantenna solutions in mmWave are generally implemented with phase shifters which are known to have good interference rejection capabilities. However, phase shifters are power-demanding components and, depending on their resolution, they require bulky hardware solutions able to accommodate the control lines. On the other hand, the use of switches leads to a cost-efficient alternative able to provide a sufficiently large interference rejection while substantially reducing the hardware cost and power consumption. This work proposes a beamforming scheme able to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) assuming that the beamforming weights can only take 0 and 1 values. The resulting optimization problem is a binary quadratic fractional problem which is a difficult non-convex problem. Two optimization approaches are proposed; namely, the semidefinite relaxation and the penalized convex-concave procedure. We show that both techniques behave well in the considered scenarios and their performance is close to the optimization problem upper bound value.},

On the other hand, it was also envisaged that such a problem could be circumvented by the use of more than two antennas. This work is a first step in this direction, extending the original radar proposal from two to an arbitrary number of antennas. In addition to designing an optimum detector for the new radar, we assess its performance by deriving asymptotic, closed-form expressions for the resulting detection and false-alarm probabilities. As a term of comparison, we also design and analyze a suboptimal detection scheme based on the traditional phased-array approach. Numerical examples are given to validate the provided analysis and to illustrate the performance agin achieved from the use of additional antennas.},

  abstract = {Indoor positioning system (IPS) has shown great potentials with the growth of context-aware computing. Typical IPS requires the tracked subject to carry a physical device. In this study, we present MaLDIP, a novel, machine learning based, device free technique for indoor positioning. To design the device free setting, we exploited the Channel State Information (CSI) obtained from Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM). The system works by utilizing frequency diversity and spatial diversity properties of CSI at target location by correlating the impact of human presence to certain changes on the received signal features. However, accurate modeling of the effect of a subject on fine grained CSI is challenging due to the presence of multipaths. We propose a novel subcarrier selection method to remove the multipath affected subcarriers to improve the performance of localization. We select the most location-dependent features from channel response based upon the wireless propagation model and propose to apply a machine learning based approach for location estimation, where the localization problem is shifted to a cell identification problem using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier. Experimental results show that MaLDIP can estimate location in a passive device free setting with a high accuracy using MIMO-OFDM system.},

The proposed method is based on the adoption of a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture, which is inspired by similar approaches used for image segmentation. A further post-processing step is applied to the output of the proposed neural network, which induces the output state sequence to be consistent with the natural sequence of states within a heart sound signal (S1, systole, S2, diastole). The proposed approach is tested on heart sound signals longer than 5 seconds from the publicly available PhysioNet dataset, and it is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art segmentation methods by achieving an average sensitivity of 93.4% and an average positive predictive value of 94.5% in detecting S1 and S2 sounds.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a pedestrian navigation algorithm based on a foot-mounted 9 Degree of Freedom (DOF) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which provides tri-axial accelerations, angular rates and magnetics. Most algorithms used worldwide employ Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) to reduce the tremendous error of integration from acceleration to displacement. The crucial part in ZUPT is to detect stance phase precisely. A cyclic left-to-right style Hidden Markov Model is introduced in this work which is able to appropriately model the periodic nature of signals. Stance detection is then made unsupervised by using a suited learning algorithm. Then orientation estimation is performed independently by a quaternion-based method, a simplified error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) assists trajectory reconstruction in 3D space, neither extra method nor prior knowledge is needed to estimate the height. Experimental results on large free-walking trajectories show that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate locations, especially in z-axis compared to competitive algorithms, w.r.t. to a ground-truth obtained using OpenStreetMap.},

The proposed method utilizes the LER condition to directly approximate the true TDOAs so that the originally nonlinear TDOA equations can be recast into ones linearly related to the source position. This enables the use of the closed-form weighted least squares (WLS) technique for source localization and makes the proposed method have lower complexity than the existing technique. The approximate efficiency of the new algorithm is established analytically under strong LER condition. The associated approximation bias is also derived and it is shown numerically to be greater than that of the benchmark technique, especially when LER condition is weak. However, through iterating the proposed method once with bias correction, the proposed method yields comparable localization accuracy with reduced complexity. The theoretical developments are validated by computer simulations.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {101-105},
  abstract = {Scalp electrical recordings, or electroencephalograms (EEG), are heavily contaminated by cranial and cervical muscle activity from as low as 20 hertz, even in relaxed conditions. It is therefore necessary to reduce or remove this contamination to enable reliable exploration of brain neurophysiological responses. Scalp measurements record activity from many sources, including neural and muscular. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) produces components ideally corresponding to separate sources, but the number of components is limited by the number of EEG channels. In practice, at most 30% of components are cleanly separate sources. Increasing the number of channels results in more separate components, but with a significant increase in costs of data collection and computation. Here we present results to assist in selecting an appropriate number of channels. Our unique database of pharmacologically paralysed subjects provides a way to objectively compare different approaches to achieving an ideal, muscle free EEG recording. We evaluated an automatic muscle-removing approach, based on ICA, with different numbers of EEG channels: 21, 32, 64, and 115. Our results show that, for a fixed length of data, 21 channels is insufficient to reduce tonic muscle artefact, and that increasing the number of channels to 115 does result in better tonic muscle artefact reduction.},

The interior sound field is sparsely represented using overcomplete plane- wave functions. Two models using harmonic functions and a low-rank structure are proposed for the exterior sound field. The separation algorithms for each model are derived by the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Despite of their promising classification rates, the choice of PZMs is debatable because other types of moments exist. In this paper, our purpose is to compare various kinds of micro-Doppler features such as Zernike moments, PZMs, orthogonal Mellin-Fourier moments, Legendre moments and Krawtchouk moments in order to evaluate which moments are the most relevant in terms of reconstruction ability, computational cost and micro-Doppler classification rate. Advantages and drawbacks of each family of moments are also given. Through the simulations we carried out, when the signal is disturbed by an additive white noise and the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the use of Krawtchouk moments as micro-Doppler features turns out to be the best compromise.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {947-951},
  abstract = {Adversarial classification is the task of performing robust classification in the presence of a strategic attacker. Originating from information hiding and multimedia forensics, adversarial classification recently received a lot of attention in a broader security context. In the domain of machine learning-based image classification, adversarial classification can be interpreted as detecting so-called adversarial examples, which are slightly altered versions of benign images. They are specifically crafted to be misclassified with a very high probability by the classifier under attack. Neural networks, which dominate among modern image classifiers, have been shown to be especially vulnerable to these adversarial examples. However, detecting subtle changes in digital images has always been the goal of multimedia forensics and steganalysis, two major subfields of multimedia security. We highlight the conceptual similarities between these fields and secure machine learning. Furthermore, we adapt a linear filter, similar to early steganalysis methods, to detect adversarial examples that are generated with the projected gradient descent (PGD) method, the state-of-the-art algorithm for this task. We test our method on the MNIST database and show for several parameter combinations of PGD that our method can reliably detect adversarial examples. Additionally, the combination of adversarial re-training and our detection method effectively reduces the attack surface of attacks against neural networks. Thus, we conclude that adversarial examples for image classification possibly do not withstand detection methods from steganalysis, and future work should explore the effectiveness of known techniques from multimedia security in other adversarial settings.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {1277-1281},
  abstract = {Recently, transmit beamforming for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has received considerable attention. Extensive studies have been done on MISO/MIMO SWIPT beamforming for broadcast channels (BCs) and interfering broadcast channels (IBCs). However, for IBCs the optimal SWIPT beamforming solution is in general not available. In this work, we consider SWIPT beamforming for multiuser MISO IBCs with multi-type receives, including pure information receivers (IRs), pure energy receivers (ERs) and simultaneous information and energy receivers. A power minimization problem with SINR and power transfer constraints on the receivers is considered. This problem is shown to be NP-hard in general. In order to get an efficient SWIPT beamforming solution, the energy-signal-aided SWIPT beamforming scheme is employed at the transmission. We show that with the help of the energy signals, the resultant beamforming problem is no longer NP-hard, and can be optimally solved by semidefinite relaxation (SDR).

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of pronunciation conversion (PC) task, a problem to reduce non-native accents in speech while preserving the original speaker identity. Although PC can be regarded as a special class of voice conversion (VC), a straightforward application of conventional VC methods to a PC task would not be successful since with VC the original speaker identity of input speech may also change. This problem is due to the fact that two functions, namely an accent conversion function and a speaker similarity conversion function, are entangled in an acoustic feature mapping function. This paper proposes dynamic frequency warping (DFW)-based spectral conversion to solve this problem. The proposed DFW-based PC converts the pronunciation of input speech by relocating the formants to the corresponding positions in which native speakers tend to locate their formants. We expect the speaker identity is preserved because other factors such as formant powers are kept unchanged. in a low frequency domain evaluation results confirmed that DFW-based PC with spectral residual modeling showed higher speaker similarity to original speaker while showing a comparable effect of reducing foreign accents to a conventional GMM-based VC method.},

The system uses two microphones to detect speech signals arriving from specific directions. The target language for speech recognition is selected on the basis of the DOA. Both the speech detection and target language selection relieves users from operations normally required for individual utterances, without serious increase in computational costs. In a speech-recognition evaluation of the proposed system, 80 % word accuracy was achieved for utterances recorded with two microphones that were 40cm distant from speaker positions. This accuracy is nearly equivalent to that in which the time frame and target language of a user's speech are given in advance.},

Information of the object level in the rendered output is important for loudness and dynamic range control applications, e.g., in broadcast. This paper proposes a method for estimating the object level in an arbitrary output scene based on the downmix signal level that is then projected through the combined un-mixing and rendering matrix. This avoids explicit reconstruction of the objects only for the level estimation offering computational complexity savings. In the evaluations, the proposed method shows a high estimation accuracy with a root-mean squared error of 0.26 LUFS (loudness units relative to full scale) compared to 3.7 L UFS of the baseline with object reconstructions.},

OSA is common and can have severe impacts, but often remains unrecognized. In this study, we propose a novel method which able to detect OSA subjects while they are awake, by analyzing breathing sounds during speech. The hypothesis is that OSA is associated with anatomical and functional abnormalities of the upper airway, which in turn, affect the acoustic parameters of a natural breathing sound during speech. The proposed OSA detector is a fully automated system, which consists of three consecutive steps including: 1) locating breathing sounds during continuous speech, 2) extracting acoustic features that quantify the breathing properties, and 3) OSA/non-OSA classification based on the detected breathing sounds. Based on breathing sounds analysis alone (90 male subjects; 72 for training, 18 for validation), our system yields an encouraging results (accuracy of 76.5%) showing the potential of speech analysis to detect OSA. Such a system can be integrated with other non-contact OSA detectors to provide a reliable and OSA syndrome-screening tool.},

This possibility can be exploited in several application scenarios, such as virtual and augmented reality or depth estimation. In this framework many issues arise due different aspects such as the large amount of generated data or to the need of dedicated and expensive hardware for Light Field capturing. Moreover, the Light Field carries information about the entire scene and the data that is delivered to the users largely differs from the traditional 2D and 3D media in terms of content and way of fruition. Dedicated rendering technology and devices for the Light Field are nowadays still not mature or quite expensive and the best option is to render the Light Field data on a conventional 2D screen. Consequently, there is the need for finding the best visualization technique that allows to exploit the information in the Light Field while being accepted by the viewers. In this paper we address this issue by considering six visualization options and by running experimental tests to study which is the technique preferred by the users.},

The so-called convolution dictionary learning (CDL) problem is therefore formulated for the purpose. Most of the solvers for CDL alternately update the coefficients and dictionary in an iterative manner, and as a consequence, numerous redundant iterations incur slow speed in achieving convergence. Moreover, their convergence properties can hardly be analyzed even though the ℓ0 sparse inducing function is approximated by the convex ℓ0 norm. In this article, we propose an algorithm which directly deals with the non-convex non-smooth ℓ0 constraint and provides a sound convergence property. The experimental results show that, the proposed method achieves the convergence point with less time and a smaller final function value compared to the existing convolutional dictionary learning algorithms.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {341-345},
  abstract = {Recently many subspace-based localization methods were developed for estimating the directions of arrivals (DOAs) and ranges of multiple narrowband signals in near-field. However, most of them usually encounter “saturation behavior” in estimation performance regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of array snapshots is not sufficiently large enough. In this paper, we investigate the problem of localizing multiple narrowband near-field signals impinging on a symmetrical uniform linear array (ULA). Firstly, by exploiting the anti-diagonal elements of the array covariance matrix, a new linear prediction approach with truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed to estimate the location parameters (i.e., DOA and range) of the incident signals. Secondly, as a measure against the impact of finite array data, an alternating iterative scheme is presented to improve the estimation accuracy of the location parameters, where the “saturation behavior” encountered in most of localization methods is solved effectively.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel vertex based sampling method for k-bandlimited signals lying on arbitrary graphs, that has a reasonable computational complexity and results in low reconstruction error. Our goal is to find the smallest set of vertices that can guarantee a perfect reconstruction of any k-bandlimited signal on any connected graph. We propose to iteratively search for the vertices that yield the minimum reconstruction error, by minimizing the maximum eigenvalue of the error covariance matrix using a linear solver. We compare the performance of our method with state-of-the-art sampling strategies and random sampling on graphs. Experimental results show that our method successfully computes the smallest sample sets on arbitrary graphs without any parameter tuning. It provides a small reconstruction error, and is robust to noise.},

  pages = {1542-1546},
  abstract = {Speech signals, captured by a microphone array mounted to a smart loudspeaker device, can be contaminated by ambient noise. In this paper, we present an online multichannel algorithm, based on the recursive EM (REM) procedure, to suppress ambient noise and enhance the speech signal. In the E-step of the proposed algorithm, a multichannel Wiener filter (MCWF) is applied to enhance the speech signal. The MCWF parameters, that is, the power spectral density (PSD) of the anechoic speech, the steering vector, and the PSD matrix of the noise, are estimated in the M-step. The proposed algorithm is specifically suitable for online applications since it uses only past and current observations and requires no iterations. To evaluate the proposed algorithm we used two sets of measurements. In the first set, static scenarios were generated by convolving speech utterances with real room impulse responses (RIRs) recorded in our acoustic lab with reverberation time set to 0.16 s and several signal to directional noise ratio (SDNR) levels. The second set was used to evaluate dynamic scenarios by using real recordings acquired by CEVA “smart and connected” development platform. Two practical use cases were evaluated: 1) estimating the steering vector with a known noise PSD matrix and 2) estimating the noise PSD matrix with a known steering vector. In both use cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline multichannel denoising algorithms.},

  abstract = {A protein contact map is a simplified matrix representation of the protein structure, where the spatial proximity of two amino acid residues is reflected. Although the accurate prediction of protein inter-residue contacts from the amino acid sequence is an open problem, considerable progress has been made in recent years. This progress has been driven by the development of contact predictors that identify the coevolutionary events occurring in a protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA). However, it has been shown that these methods introduce Gaussian noise in the estimated contact map, making its reduction necessary. In this paper, we propose the use of two different Gaussian denoising approximations in order to enhance the protein contact estimation. These approaches are based on (i) sparse representations over learned dictionaries, and (ii) deep residual convolutional neural networks. The results highlight that the residual learning strategy allows a better reconstruction of the contact map, thus improving contact predictions.},

  pages = {296-300},
  abstract = {Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are one of several underlying signals used in various electroencephalography (EEG) based applications, including brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Through oscillating visual stimulus at distinct frequencies, an SSVEP can be detected by EEG at occipital electrodes on the scalp, with distinct visual stimuli representing distinct choices. Rapid, accurate detection and classification of these signals is crucial for real-time analysis in SSVEP-based applications. However, signal analysis and interpretation of SSVEP events may be hindered in children due to the significant variability in electrophysiological signals throughout development. Recently, multi-way tensors have been shown capable of exploiting higher-order interactions present in the naturally multi-dimensional EEG data. Using tensors as tools to identify latent structures between varying maturational signals thus may provide a potential solution for rapid classification of SSVEP signals in children at different developmental stages. The presented methodology builds upon previous tensor-based SSVEP analysis and extends it for the first time to developing paediatric populations. Results from a binary SSVEP classification task of n = 40 children age 8-11 are reported to be significantly greater than chance, at 67-74% accuracy across multiple training and testing blocks. The findings support that tensor decomposition could provide flexible advantages capable of accommodating developmental differences across children and lay groundwork for future tensor analysis in SSVEP-based applications, like BCIs.},

In this paper, a halftoning algorithm is proposed to reduce the color distortion of an image print in the view of a colorblind person and embed hints in the image print for a colorblind person to distinguish the confusing colors. To people with normal vision, the color halftone looks the same as the original image when it is viewed at a reasonable distance, which is not achievable when conventional techniques such as recoloring and pattern overlaying are used to produce a color print for the colorblind. Besides, no dedicated hardware is required to view the printed image.},

We solve the optimization problem through relaxation, and use simulations to illustrate the characteristics of the solution. These simulations show that energy sharing takes place when there are differences in the load/generation and price profiles across participants. We also show that no energy sharing takes place when the load is above the local generation at all times.},

Building on the aforementioned facts, a robust collaborative Kalman filter is proposed for stock price prediction within the context of time-evolving dyadic processes, where the prediction error is treated as a heavy-tailed noise whose variance is a properly modeled random variable. Variational approximation is exploited to make posterior inference tractable. The proposed model captures the volatility of stock prices through time, yielding more accurate predictions than the state-of-the-art and enabling the consistent tracking of the extreme values of stock prices.},

In the present study, the approach is extended towards multichannel cases. The superimposed sound field reproduced by multiple sources is recorded with one microphone, and the individual impulse responses are identified. To this end, the sound sources are excited with the same periodic perfect sequence, but a different amount of temporal shift is applied so that the identified impulse responses of different sources do not overlap. An anti-aliasing condition for the microphone speed is derived which is computed based on the spatial bandwidth of the sound field.},

The proposed parallel algorithm consists in optimizing a sequence of successively refined approximate functions. Compared with the popular iterative soft-thresholding algorithm commonly known as ISTA, which is the benchmark algorithm for such problems, it has two attractive features which lead to a notable reduction in the algorithm's complexity: the proposed approximate function does not have to be a global upper bound of the original function, and the stepsize can be efficiently computed by the line search scheme which is carried out over a properly constructed differentiable function. Furthermore, when the parallel algorithm cannot be fully parallelized due to memory/processor constraints, we propose a hybrid updating scheme that divides the whole set of variables into blocks which are updated sequentially. Since the stepsize is obtained by performing the line search along the coordinate of each block variable, the proposed hybrid algorithm converges faster than state-of-the-art hybrid algorithms based on constant stepsizes and/or decreasing stepsizes. Finally, the proposed algorithms are numerically tested.},

In this paper, Summed Parallel Infinite Impulse Response (SPIIR) GW detection pipeline is further optimized using recent GPU techniques to improve its throughput and reduce its latency. Two main computational bottlenecks have been studied: the SPIIR filtering and the coherent postprocessing which combines multiple GW detector outputs. In the filtering part, inefficient memory access is accelerated by exploiting temporal locality of input data, where the performance over previous implementation is improved by a factor of 2.5-3.5x on different GPUs. The post-processing part is improved by employing multiple strategies and a speedup of 12-25x is achieved. Once again, it is shown that GPUs can be very useful to tackle computational challenges in GW detection.},

In this paper convolutional neural network binarization is implemented on GPU-based platforms for real-time inference on resource constrained devices. In binarized networks, all weights and intermediate computations between layers are quantized to +1 and -1, allowing multiplications and additions to be replaced with bit-wise operations between 32-bit words. This representation completely eliminates the need for floating point multiplications and additions and decreases both the computational load and the memory footprint compared to a full-precision network implemented in floating point, making it well-suited for resource-constrained environments. We compare the performance of our implementation with an equivalent floating point implementation on one desktop and two embedded GPU platforms.

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of dimension reduction of noisy data, more precisely the challenge to determine the dimension of the subspace where the observed signal lives in. Based on results from random matrix theory, two novel estimators of the signal dimension are proposed in this paper. Consistency of the estimators is proved in the modern asymptotic regime, where the number of parameters grows proportionally with the sample size. Experimental results show that the novel estimators are robust to noise and, moreover, they give highly accurate results in settings where standard methods fail. We apply the novel dimension estimators to several life sciences benchmarks in the context of classification, and illustrate the improvements achieved by the new methods compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {Dictionary learning (DL) has found many applications in sparse approximation problems. Two important properties of a dictionary are maximum and average coherence (cross- correlation) between its atoms. Many algorithms have been presented to take into account the coherence between atoms during dictionary learning. Some of them mainly reduce the maximum (mutual) coherence whereas some other algorithms decrease the average coherence. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly reduce the maximum and average correlations between different atoms. This is done by making a balance between reducing the maximum and average co- herences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduce the mutual and average coherence of the dictionary better than existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {The performance of speech beamformers relies on a good estimation of the relative transfer function (RTF) between the captured clean speech at each microphone. Most of the proposed RTF estimators make assumptions about the clean speech statistics or need a joint estimation of the RTF and the signal statistics. In this work we propose a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the RTF in an extended Kalman filter (eKF) framework. Our method exploits the knowledge about the RTF and noise statistics with no assumptions about the clean speech statistics. The proposed approach is evaluated when employed in combination with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming in a dual-microphone smartphone. To this end, a database of simulated dual-channel noisy speech recordings on a smartphone was used. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the most accurate RTF estimates among the evaluated methods, yielding less speech distortion and better intelligibility while competitive perceptual quality performance is obtained.},

  abstract = {The emergence of efficient algorithms in variational and Bayesian frameworks braught significant advances to the field of inverse problems. However, such problems remain challenging when the observation operator is not perfectly known. In this paper we propose a Bayesian Plug-and-Play (PP) algorithm for solving a wide range of inverse problems where the signal/image is sparse in the original domain and the observation operator has to be estimated. The principle consists of plugging the prior considered for the target observation operator and keep using the same algorithm. The proposed method relies on a generic proximal non-smooth sampling scheme. This genericity makes the proposed algorithm novel in the sense that it can be used to solve a wide range or inverse problems. Our method is illustrated on a deblurring problem with unknown blur operator where promising results are obtained.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of Time-Difference of Arrivals (TDOAs) is necessary to perform accurate sound source localization. The problem has traditionally been solved by using methods such as Generalized Cross-Correlation, which uses the entire signal to accurately estimate TDOAs. However, this could pose a problem in distributed sensor networks in which the amount of data that can be transmitted from each sensor to a fusion center is limited, such as in underwater scenarios or other challenging environments. Inspired by approaches from computer vision, in this paper we identify Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoints in the signal spectrogram. We perform crosscorrelation on the signal using only the information available at those extracted keypoints. We test our algorithm in scenarios featuring different noise and reverberation conditions, and using different speech signals and source locations. We show that our algorithm can estimate Time-Difference of Arrivals (TDOAs) and the source location within an acceptable error range at a compression ratio of 40: 1.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {425-429},
  abstract = {One of the major challenges in wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASN) based speech enhancement is robust and accurate voice activity detection (VAD). VAD is widely used in speech enhancement, speech coding, speech recognition, etc. In speech enhancement applications, VAD plays an important role, since noise statistics can be updated during non-speech frames to ensure efficient noise reduction and tolerable speech distortion. Although significant efforts have been made in single channel VAD, few solutions can be found in the multichannel case, especially in WASN. In this paper, we introduce a distributed VAD by using model-based noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation. For each node in the network, the speech PSD and noise PSD are first estimated, then a distributed detection is made by applying the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The proposed global GLRT based VAD has a quite general form. Indeed, we can judge whether the speech is present or absent by using the current time frame and frequency band observation or by taking into account the neighbouring frames and bands. Finally, the distributed GLRT result is obtained by using a distributed consensus method, such as random gossip, i.e., the whole detection system does not need any fusion center. With the model-based noise estimation method, the proposed distributed VAD performs robustly under non-stationary noise conditions, such as babble noise. As shown in experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional multichannel VAD methods in terms of detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {Detecting the presence of speakers and suitably localize them in indoor environments undoubtedly represent two important tasks in the speech processing community. Several algorithms have been proposed for Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speaker LOCalization (SLOC) so far, while their accomplishment by means of a joint integrated model has not received much attention. In particular, no studies focused on cooperative exploitation of VAD and SLOC information by means of machine learning have been conducted, up to the authors' knowledge. That is why the authors propose in this work a data driven approach for joint speech detection and speaker localization, relying on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which simultaneously process LogMel and GCC-PHAT Patterns features. The proposed algorithm is compared with a two-stage model composed by the cascade of a neural network (NN) based VAD and an NN based SLOC, discussed in previous authors' contributions. Computer simulations, accomplished against the DIRHA dataset addressing a multi-room acoustic environment, show that the proposed method allows to achieve a remarkable relative reduction of speech activity detection error equal to 33% compared to the original NN based VAD. Moreover, the overall localization accuracy is improved as well, by employing the joint model as speech detector and the standard neural SLOC system in cascade.},

  abstract = {The detection of acoustic scenes is a challenging problem in which environmental sound events must be detected from a given audio signal. This includes classifying the events as well as estimating their onset and offset times. We approach this problem with a neural network architecture that uses the recently-proposed capsule routing mechanism. A capsule is a group of activation units representing a set of properties for an entity of interest, and the purpose of routing is to identify part-whole relationships between capsules. That is, a capsule in one layer is assumed to belong to a capsule in the layer above in terms of the entity being represented. Using capsule routing, we wish to train a network that can learn global coherence implicitly, thereby improving generalization performance. Our proposed method is evaluated on Task 4 of the DCASE 2017 challenge. Results show that classification performance is state-of-the-art, achieving an F-score of 58.6%. In addition, overfitting is reduced considerably compared to other architectures.},

  abstract = {JPEG compression is one of the most popular image compression methods. The manipulation history of JPEG compression provides evidence of operational information about the device or software utilized to generate an image. Besides, JPEG compression introduces complex compression artifacts, particularly the blocking artifacts, ringing effects and blurring, which lower the image visual quality. Therefore, erasing the traces left by JPEG compression is of great importance. To solve this problem, we present a JPEG compression anti-forensic method adopting the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator can automatically learn how to hide the traces left by JPEG compression during the optimization process against the discriminator. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that the anti-forensically modified images generated by our method can deceive the existing JPEG compression detectors and have very good visual quality.},

In our scheme, view synthesis based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used as a first prediction step to exploit inter-view correlation. Super-rays are then constructed to capture the inter-view and spatial redundancy remaining in the prediction residues. To ensure that the super-ray segmentation is highly correlated with the residues to be encoded, the super-rays are computed on synthesized residues (the difference between the four transmitted corner views and their corresponding synthesized views), instead of the synthesized views. Neighboring super-rays are merged into a larger super-ray according to a rate-distortion cost. A 4D shape adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA - DCT) is applied per super-rayon the prediction residues in both the spatial and angular dimensions. A traditional coding scheme consisting of quantization and entropy coding is then used for encoding the transformed coefficients. Experimental results show that the proposed coding scheme outperforms HEVC-based schemes at low hitrate.},

The precise localization of other road participants (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs) is demanded at lane level, to enable higher semantic analysis of the scene. This requires a lane detection and modeling stage able to provide the number of existing lanes, and their precise local geometry. The current trend in computer vision is to use the full power of GPU technology with deep learning-based detection methods, which requires costly high-end platforms, and difficult the co-existence with other heavy-processing functions (e.g. vehicle detection), specially critical when considering a single platform processing multiple cameras and Laser scanners. In this paper we propose an efficient lane detection and modeling pipeline, composed of optimized steps for segmentation, transformation, modeling, control and tracking. The method is able to detect multiple lanes and their curvature, in continuous function, with minimal processing power requirements, thus enabling its implementation into low-cost embedded platforms.

  year = {2018},
  pages = {371-375},
  abstract = {Today's demands regarding workpiece quality in cutting machine tool processing require automated monitoring of both machine condition and the cutting process. Currently, best-performing monitoring approaches rely on high-frequency acoustic emission (AE) sensor data and definition of advanced features, which involve complex computations. This approach is challenging for machine monitoring via embedded sensor systems with constrained computational power and energy budget. To cope with constrained energy, we rely on data recording with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) vibration sensors, which rely on lower-frequency sampling. To clarify whether these lower-frequency signals bear information for typical machine monitoring prediction tasks, we evaluate data for the most generic machine monitoring task of tool condition monitoring (TCM). To cope with computational complexity of advanced features, we introduce two intelligent preprocessing algorithms. First, we split non-stationary signals of recurrent structure into similar segments. Then, we identify most discriminative spectral differences in the segmented signals that allow for best separation of classes for the given TCM task. Subsequent feature extraction only in most relevant signal segments and spectral regions enables high expressiveness even for simple features. Extensive evaluation of the outlined approach on multiple data sets of different combinations of cutting machine tools, tool types and workpieces confirms its sensibility. Intelligent preprocessing enables reliable identification of stationary segments and most discriminative frequency bands. With subsequent extraction of simple but tailor-made features in these spectral-temporal regions of interest (Rols), TCM typically framed as multi feature classification problem can be converted to a single feature threshold comparison problem with an average F1 score of 97.89%.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates different algorithms to perform image restoration from single-photon measurements corrupted with Poisson noise. The restoration problem is formulated in a Bayesian framework and several state-of-the-art Monte Carlo samplers are considered to estimate the unknown image and quantify its uncertainty. The different samplers are compared through a series of experiments conducted with synthetic images. The results demonstrate the scaling properties of the proposed samplers as the dimensionality of the problem increases and the number of photons decreases. Moreover, our experiments show that for a certain photon budget (i.e., acquisition time of the imaging device), downsampling the observations can yield better reconstruction results.},

  abstract = {Deterioration of road and pavement surface conditions is an issue which directly affects the majority of the world today. The complex structure and textural similarities of surface cracks, as well as noise and image illumination variation makes automated detection a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network to perform pixel-wise classification of surface cracks on road and pavement images. The network consists of an encoder layer which reduces the input image to a bank of lower level feature maps. This is followed by a corresponding decoder layer which maps the encoded features back to the resolution of the input data using the indices of the encoder pooling layers to perform efficient up-sampling. The network is finished with a classification layer to label individual pixels. Training time is minimal due to the small amount of training/validation data (80 training images and 20 validation images). This is important due to the lack of applicable public data available. Despite this lack of data, we are able to perform image segmentation (pixel-level classification) on a number of publicly available road crack datasets. The network was tested extensively and the results obtained indicate performance in direct competition with that of the current state-of-the-art methods.},

If the walking or standing person is observed directly, its m-D is measured. In the case of a person mirrored on a reflecting object, only the m-D of the reflecting object is measured. Their spectrogram is differentiable which enables a classification. One difficulty is the random movement of the handheld radar which leads to short observation durations and Doppler blurring. A classification based on short spectrograms is proposed, where the influence of the short-time Fourier transform window length is investigated. Furthermore, a regularization is proposed to improve the classifier interpretability for this safety application.},

During an investigation, it could be crucial to be able to distinguish images coming directly from a photo-camera with respect to those downloaded from a social network and possibly, in this last circumstance, determining which is the SN among a defined group. It is well known that each SN leaves peculiar traces on each content during the upload-download process; such traces can be exploited to make image classification. In this work, the idea is to use the PRNU, embedded in every acquired images, as the “carrier” of the particular SN traces which diversely modulate the PRNU. We demonstrate, in this paper, that SN-modulated noise residual can be adopted as a feature to detect the social network of origin by means of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).},

Once that the locus of solutions has been defined, it is necessary to introduce a suitable selection criterion in order to identify a single solution. The criterion proposed in the paper is based on the comparison of the theoretical statistical properties of the residual of the noisy M-AR model with those computed from the data. The results obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms some existing methods.},

However, since it relies on seeking the solution of a non-convex penalized matrix factorization problem, its performances largely depend on the optimization strategy. In this context, Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) has become a standard algorithm which, despite its theoretical grounding, generally provides poor practical separation results. In this work, we first investigate the origins of these limitations, which are shown to take their roots in the sensitivity to both the initialization and the regularization parameter choice. As an alternative, we propose a novel strategy that combines a heuristic approach with PALM. We show its relevance on realistic astrophysical data.},

Results show that EVS at 9.6 kbit/s with 100% application-layer redundancy has significantly higher packet loss resilience in degraded channel conditions (≥ 3 % PLR), for an overall bit rate (around 2×9.6 kbit/s) compatible with VoLTE (assuming a VoLTE bearer configured to a maximum rate of 24.4 kbit/s). We also discuss the relative merit of the partial redundancy mode in the EVS codec at 13.2 kbit/s, known as the channel-aware mode (CAM), and possible RTP/RTCP signaling methods to trigger the use of application-layer redundancy.},

Full-reference HDR metrics have been designed in the last years to achieve this objective: HDR- VDP2, HDR-VQM, PU-encoding metrics. Recent studies have pointed out that HDR-VDP2 is one of the best metric. Unfortunately, HDR-VDP2 is quite complex to use due to numerous and sometimes hard-to-know parameters such as display emission spectrum, surround luminance and angular resolution. In this paper, we show that HDR-VDP2 does not require an accurate knowledge of the viewing condition parameters. For that, we not only test the impact of these parameters on existing image databases of subjective quality scores, but also we propose a new and complementary image database made with a different HDR display.},

Parametric representation of the spectral basis is beneficial as it can encompass the signal characteristics like, e.g. the speech production model. It is observed that the parametric representation of basis vectors is beneficial while performing online speech enhancement in low delay scenarios.},

  abstract = {A wide-spread approach for modeling and for the performance evaluation of wireless networks is employing Poisson point processes (PPPs). There, the general assumption is that an infinite number of nodes is distributed in the network environment. This is not problematic in a purely analytic framework, but is unfeasible when Monte-Carlo system level simulations are employed for network evaluation. In order to obtain results in a finite simulation-duration, the simulation area also has to be finite, which leads to a deviation of performance results when compared to analytical approach with infinitely many base stations. This deviation however is only small when the simulation area is sufficiently large. In this paper we discuss which part of the simulation area yields results whose deviation from the analytical results does not exceed a predefined threshold. We present an approximation that is based on the base station geometry and depends on the base station density. Additionally, we discuss the relationship of the minimal simulation area (the smallest area that allows to obtain reliable coverage results) and the reduced simulation overhead by increasing the simulation area.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {568-572},
  abstract = {The groundbreaking theory of compressive sensing (CS) enables reconstructing many common classes or real-world signals from a number of samples that is well below that prescribed by the Shannon sampling theorem, which exclusively relates to the bandwidth of the signal. Differently, CS takes profit of the sparsity or compressibility of the signals in an appropriate basis to reconstruct them from few measurements. A large number of algorithms exist for solving the sparse recovery problem, which can be roughly classified in greedy pursuits and l1 minimization algorithms. Chambolle and Pock's (C&P) primal-dual l1minimization algorithm has shown to deliver state-of-the-art results with optimal convergence rate. In this work we present an algorithm for l1 minimization that operates in the null space of the measurement matrix and follows a Nesterov-accelerated gradient descent structure. Restriction to the null space allows the algorithm to operate in a minimal-dimension subspace. A further novelty lies on the fact that the cost function is no longer the l1 norm of the temporal solution, but a weighted sum of its entropy and its l1 norm. The inclusion of the entropy pushes the l1 minimization towards a de facto quasi-10 minimization, while the l1 norm term avoids divergence. Our algorithm globally outperforms C&P and other recent approaches for l1 minimization in terms of l2reconstruction error, including a different entropy-based method.},

  abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) face a great challenge: how to harness the wide variability of brain signals from a user to another. The most visible problem is the lack of a sound framework to capture the specificity of a user brain waves. A first attempt to leverage this issue is to design user-specific spatial filters, carefully adjusted with a lengthy calibration phase. A second, more recent, opening is the systematic study of brain signals through their covariance, in an appropriate space from a geometric point of view. Riemannian geometry allows to efficiently characterize the variability of inter-subject EEG, even with noisy or scarce data. This contribution is the first attempt for SSVEP-based BCI to make the most of the available data from a user, relying on Riemannian geometry to estimate the similarity with a multi-user dataset. The proposed method is built in the framework of transfer learning and borrows the notion of composite mean to partition the space. This method is evaluated on 12 subjects performing an SSVEP task for the control of an exoskeleton arm and the results show the contribution of Riemannian geometry and of the user-specific composite mean, whereas there is only a few data available for a subject.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the state-of-the-art approach to unsupervised audio source separation. It relies on the factorization of a given short-time frequency transform into a dictionary of spectral patterns and an activation matrix. Recently, we introduced transform learning for NMF (TL-NMF), in which the short-time transform is learnt together with the nonnegative factors. We imposed the transform to be orthogonal likewise the usual Fourier or Cosine transform. TL-NMF yields an original non-convex optimization problem over the manifold of orthogonal matrices, for which we proposed a projected gradient descent algorithm in our previous work. In this contribution we describe a new Jacobi approach in which the orthogonal matrix is represented as a randomly chosen product of elementary Givens matrices. The new approach performs favorably as compared to the gradient approach, in particular in terms of robustness with respect to initialization, as illustrated with synthetic and audio decomposition experiments.

Tip-timing is one of the classical measurement methods but its main drawback is the generation of sub-sampled and non-uniform sampled signals. This paper presents a new sparse method for tip-timing spectral analysis that makes use of engine rotation variations. Assuming that blade vibration signals yield to line spectra, a sparse signal model is introduced as a linear system. The solution to the problem is obtained by ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) with a p1 -regularization. Results for simulated and real signals are given to illustrate the efficiency of this method. The main advantages of the proposed method are to provide a fast solution and to take into account the variations of the rotation speed. Results show that this approach reduces frequency aliasings caused by the low sampling frequency of the measured signals.},

Traditionally, Compressed Sensing (CS) based techniques have been employed for this task. CS based techniques are iterative in nature; hence inversion process is time-consuming and cannot be deployed for the real-time reconstruction process. These inversion processes are transductive in nature. With the recent development in deep learning - auto encoders, CNN based architectures have been used for learning inversion in an inductive setup. The training period for inductive learning is large but is very fast during application. But these approaches work only on the signal domain and not on the measurement domain. We show the application of CAE, which can work directly from the measurement domain. We compare CAE with a Dictionary learning based coupling setup and a recently proposed CNN based CS reconstruction algorithm. We show reconstruction capability of CAE in terms of PSNR and SSIM on a standard set of images with measurement rates of 0.04 and 0.25.},

The features used exploit a wide range of information on the sources behavior making the system robust to noise, reverberation, and music playback. We then differentiate between desired and interfering sources. The spatial information and activity level is then determined for each desired source. Experimental evaluation of a real acoustic source tracking problem with and without music playback shows promising results for the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a microcellular urban network, where micro-cells provide a wireless connection to vehicular users. We focus on vehicular relaying to enhance the quality of the V2I link and therefore to improve the overall coverage in the network. To quantify the coverage gain, we compare the performance of direct communication between microcell and vehicular user with the relay-aided communication. In the examined scenario, we create a Manhattan grid of streets where in each street micro-cell base stations and vehicular users are randomly placed according to a Poisson point process. The employed pathloss distinguishes whether the transmitter is in the same street as the receiver, in a crossing or in a parallel street. We investigate our model analytically by leveraging tools from stochastic geometry as well as by Monte Carlo system level simulations. We compare results for the relay-assisted link and the direct link depending on the user density in terms of pathloss, SINR and coverage.},

Methods intended for identifying emotions in individuals are mainly based on facial and body expressions, or even physiological measurements which are not suited for crowded environments as the available information in crowds is usually limited to that provided by surveillance cameras where the face and body of pedestrians can often suffer from occlusion. This work proposes an approach for analysing walking behaviour and exploiting the interplay of motivations and expectations in the emotions of pedestrians. Real-world data is used to test the prediction of motivations and annotations on the emotional state of pedestrians are added to evaluate the proposed method's capability to estimate emotional states. The conducted experiments show significant improvements over previous methods for estimating motivations and consistent results to the estimation of emotions.},

  abstract = {Classification or typology systems used to categorize different human body parts exist for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features. A reason for this might be that classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. Therefore, this work presents a computer-based procedure to classify facial features based on their global appearance automatically. First, facial features are located, extracted and aligned using a facial landmark detector. Then, images are characterized using the eigenpictures approach. We then perform a clustering of each type of facial feature using as input the weights extracted from the eigenpictures approach. Finally, we validate the obtained clusterings with humans. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgments from human observers and facilitates the development of taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained with this procedure are presented for eyes, noses and mouths.},

Multi-biometric verification is a typical problem where information from different sources are normalized and fused to make a binary decision and therefore a good platform to evaluate the proposed normalization. We conducted an evaluation on two publicly available databases and showed that the normalization solution we are proposing consistently outperformed state-of-the-art and best practice approaches, e.g. by reducing the false rejection rate at 0.01% false acceptance rate by 60-75% compared to the widely used z-score normalization under the sum-rule fusion.},

For high number of channels, the existing method failed to show that white noise is always the most irregular whereas the proposed method always had the entropy of white noise the highest. Application of both algorithms on MIX process signals also confirmed the ability of the proposed method to handle larger number of channels without risking erroneous results. We also applied the proposed algorithm on EEG data from epileptic patients before and after treatments. The results showed an increase in entropy values after treatment in the regions where the focus was localized. This goes in the same way as the medical point of view that indicated a better health state for these patients.},

  abstract = {In a single speech source noise reduction scenario, the frequency domain correlation matrix of the speech signal is often assumed to be a rank-l matrix. In multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) based noise reduction, this assumption may be used to define an optimization criterion to estimate the positive definite speech correlation matrix together with the noise correlation matrix, from sample `speech+noise' and `noise-only' correlation matrices. The estimated correlation matrices then define the MWF. In generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) based MWF, this optimization criterion involves a prewhitening with the sample `noise-only' correlation matrix, which in particular leads to a compact expression for the MWF. However, a more accurate form would include a prewhitening with the estimated noise correlation matrix instead of with the sample `noise-only' correlation matrix. Unfortunately this leads to a more difficult optimization problem, where the prewhitening indeed involves one of the optimization variables. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the modified optimization criterion, remarkably, leads to only minor modifications in the estimated correlation matrices and eventually the same MWF, which justifies the use of the original optimization criterion as a simpler substitute.},

  abstract = {Stereo images provide users with a vivid 3D watching experience. Supported by per-view depth maps, 3D stereo images can be used to generate any required intermediate view between the given left and right stereo views. However, 3D stereo images lead to higher transmission and storage cost compared to single view images. Based on the binocular suppression theory, mixed-quality stereo images can alleviate this problem by employing different compression ratios on the two views. This causes noticeable visual artifacts when a high compression ratio is adopted and limits free-viewpoint applications. Hence, the low quality image at the receiver side needs to be enhanced to match the high quality one. To address this problem, in this paper we propose an end-to-end fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for enhancing the low quality images in quality asymmetric stereo images by exploiting inter-view correlation.

In this paper, we extend the problem formulation of learnable compressive subsampling [1] that focuses on the learning of the best sampling operator in the Fourier domain adapted to spectral properties of training set of images. We formulate the problem as a reconstruction from a finite number of sparse samples with a prior learned from the external dataset or learned on-fly for the image to be reconstructed. The proposed methods are tested on diverse datasets covering facial images, medical and multi-band astronomical applications using the mean square error and SSIM as a perceptual measure of reconstruction. The obtained results demonstrate some interesting properties of proposed methods that might be of interest for future research and extensions.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {41-45},
  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of organs on fat-water magnetic resonance (MR) images not only enables an analysis of their morphological characteristics but also their tissues pathogenesis demonstrated by their fat fraction ratios. So far, only a few methods have been designed based on these images and all proposed segmentation algorithms have only addressed one organ at a time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deformation-/registration-free algorithm for multilabel segmentation of fat-water MR images without need to prior localizations or geometry estimations. This method involved a hierarchical random forest classifier and a hierarchical conditional random field (CRF) encoding a multi-resolution image pyramid. This pyramid was formed by extracting multiscale local and contextual features from image patches at different resolutions. The classifier used penalized multivariate linear discriminants and SMOTEBagging to mitigate limited and imbalanced training data. The CRF refined the segmentations with regard to the spatial and hierarchical consistencies of the labels by using layer-specific significant features identified over the trained random forest classifier. Also, we incorporated resolution-specific hyperparameters to handle variable numbers or class mixtures of the image patches over hierarchical structures. This method was trained and evaluated for segmenting 10 thoracic and 5 lumbar VBs and IVDs on 30 training and 30 test volumetric fat-water (2 channel) MR images. Objective evaluations revealed its comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art while demanding less computational burden.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for light field image coding relying on a high order prediction mode based on a training algorithm. The proposed approach is applied as an Intra prediction method based on a two-stage block-wise high order prediction model that supports geometric transformations up to eight degrees of freedom. Light field images comprise an array of micro-images that are related by complex perspective deformations that cannot be efficiently compensated by state-of-the-art image coding techniques, which are usually based on low order translational prediction models. The proposed prediction mode is able to exploit the non-local spatial redundancy introduced by light field image structure and a training algorithm is applied on different micro-images that are available in the reference region aiming at reducing the amount of signaling data sent to the receiver. The training direction that generates the most efficient geometric transformation for the current block is determined in the encoder side and signaled to the decoder using an index. The decoder is therefore able to repeat the high order prediction training to generate the desired geometric transformation. Experimental results show bitrate savings up to 12.57% and 50.03 % relatively to a light field image coding solution based on low order prediction without training and HEVC, respectively.},

To address semantic interpretability of learned features, we introduce a novel idea of classification by re-generation based on variational autoencoder (VAE) in which a separate encoder-decoder pair of VAE is trained for each class. Moreover, the proposed architecture overcomes the scalability issue in current DNN networks as there is no need to re-train the whole network with the addition of new classes and it can be done for each class separately. We also introduce a criterion based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to reject doubtful examples. This rejection criterion should improve the trust in the obtained results and can be further exploited to reject adversarial examples.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for model selection in linear regression by utilizing the solution path of l1 regularized least-squares (LS) approach (i.e., Lasso). This method applies the complex-valued least angle regression and shrinkage (c-LARS) algorithm coupled with a generalized information criterion (GIC) and referred to as the c-LARS-GIC method. c-LARS-GIC is a two-stage procedure, where firstly precise values of the regularization parameter, called knots, at which a new predictor variable enters (or leaves) the active set are computed in the Lasso solution path. Active sets provide a nested sequence of regression models and G I C then selects the best model. The sparsity order of the chosen model serves as an estimate of the model order and the LS fit based only on the active set of the model provides an estimate of the regression parameter vector. We then consider a source localization problem, where the aim is to detect the number of impinging source waveforms at a sensor array as well to estimate their direction-of-arrivals (DoA-S ) using only a single-snapshot measurement. We illustrate via simulations that, after formulating the problem as a grid-based sparse signal reconstruction problem, the proposed c-LARS-GIC method detects the number of sources with high probability while at the same time it provides accurate estimates of source locations.},

Quantifying the similarity between two different graphs is a crucial operation in many applications involving graphs, such as pattern recognition or social networks' analysis. This paper focuses on the graph similarity problem from the emerging graph Fourier domain, leveraging the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrices. In particular, we focus on the intuition that similar graphs should provide similar frequency representation for a particular graph signal. Similarly, we argue that the frequency responses of a particular graph filter applied to two similar graphs should be also similar. Supporting results based on numerical simulations support the aforementioned hypothesis and show that the proposed graph distances provide a new tool for comparing graphs in the frequency domain.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, forensic researchers have developed a wide set of techniques to blindly attribute an image to the device used to shoot it. Among these techniques, those based on photo response non uniformity (PRNU) have shown incredibly accurate results, thus they are often considered as a reference baseline solution. The rationale behind these techniques is that each camera sensor leaves on acquired images a characteristic noise pattern. This pattern can be estimated and uniquely mapped to a specific acquisition device through a cross-correlation test. In this paper, we study the possibility of leveraging recent findings in the deep learning field to attack PRNU-based detectors. Specifically, we focus on the possibility of editing an image through convolutional neural networks in a visually imperceptible way, still hindering PRNU noise estimation. Results show that performing such an attack is possible, even though an informed forensic analyst can reduce its impact through a smart test.},

In order to perform forensic analysis on this kind of videos, it can be useful to split the whole sequence into the set of originating shots. As video shots are seldom obtained with a single device, a possible way to identify each video shot is to exploit sensor-based traces. State-of-the-art solutions for sensor attribution rely on Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU). Despite this approach has proved robust and efficient for images, exploiting PRNU in the video domain is still challenging. In this paper, we tackle the problem of blind video temporal splicing detection leveraging PRNU-based source attribution. Specifically, we consider videos composed by few-second shots coming from various sources that have been temporally combined. The focus is on blind detection and temporal localization of splicing points. The analysis is carried out on a recently released dataset composed by videos acquired with mobile devices. The method is validated on both non-stabilized and stabilized videos, thus showing the difficulty of working in the latter scenario.},

For this problem, a novel approach is developed exploiting the Rayleigh-Ritz (RR) theory to approximate the signal subspace where the data lie and the fact that the endmembers are located at the vertices of a simplex set under a LMM. The proposed approach first estimates a subset of eigenvectors to approximate the signal subspace using the RR theory, and then vertex component analysis is applied to find the endmembers in the approximated subspace. Simulations results conducted on realistic compressive hyperspectral images show that the proposed algorithm can provide endmembers results very close to those obtained when using uncompressed images, with the advantage of using a reduced number of measurements. In particular, the numerical tests show that the proposed approach is able to estimate the endmembers using 50% of the full data.},

There might be restriction on the signal length and other issue that impose limitation where it is not possible to discard the whole signal if noise is present. Thus there is a great need to retain as much noise free regions as possible. A noise detection method is evaluated on a manually annotated subset (2146 leads) of a data base of 12-lead ECG recordings from 1006 bicycle race participants. The aim is to apply the noise detector on the unlabelled part of the data set before any further analysis is conducted. The proposed noise detector can be divided into 3 parts: 1) Select a high frequency signal as a base signal. 2) Apply a thresholding strategy on the base signal. 3) Use a noise detection strategy. In this work receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) will be used to assess a high frequency noise detector designed for ECG signals. Even though ROC analysis is widely used to assess prediction models, it has its own limitation. However, it is a good starting point to assess discriminatory ability. To generate the ROC curve the performance evaluation is based on sample-level. That is, each sample has a label whether it is noise or not. The threshold strategy and the chosen threshold will be the varying factor to generate ROC curves. The best model has an average AUC of 0.862, which shows a good detector to discriminate noise. This threshold strategy will be used for noise detection on the unlabelled part of the data set.},

  abstract = {Acoustic scene classification has drawn much research attention where labeled data are often used for model training. However, in practice, acoustic data are often unlabeled, weakly labeled, or incorrectly labeled. To classify unlabeled data, or detect and correct wrongly labeled data, we present an unsupervised clustering method based on sparse subspace clustering. The computational cost of the sparse subspace clustering algorithm becomes prohibitively high when dealing with high dimensional acoustic features. To address this problem, we introduce a random sketching method to reduce the feature dimensionality for the sparse subspace clustering algorithm. Experimental results reveal that this method can reduce the computational cost significantly with a limited loss in clustering accuracy.},

  pages = {201-205},
  abstract = {The novel view synthesis for traditional sparse light field camera arrays generally relies on an accurate depth approximation for a scene. To this end, it is preferable for such camera-array systems to integrate multiple depth cameras (e.g. Kinect V2), thereby requiring a precise registration for the integrated depth sensors. Methods based on special calibration objects have been proposed to solve the multi-Kinect V2 registration problem by using the prebuilt geometric relationships of several easily-detectable common point pairs. However, for registration tasks incapable of knowing these precise geometric relationships, this kind of method is prone to fail. To overcome this limitation, a novel Kinect V2 registration approach in a coarse-to-fine framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, both local color and geometry information is extracted directly from a static scene to recover a rigid transformation from one Kinect V2 to the other. Besides, a 3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet), i.e. 3DMatch, is utilized to describe local geometries. Experimental results show that the proposed Kinect V2 registration method using both color and deep geometry descriptors outperforms the other coarse-to-fine baseline approaches.},

  pages = {1632-1636},
  abstract = {In Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference, it is important to generate samples from a target distribution, which are then used, e.g., to compute expectations with respect to the target distribution. Quite often, the target distribution is the posterior of parameters of interest, and drawing samples from it can be exceedingly difficult. Monte Carlo-based methods, like adaptive importance sampling (AIS), is built on the importance sampling principle to approximate a target distribution using a set of samples and their corresponding weights. Variational inference (VI) attempts to approximate the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the posterior and a set of simpler parametric distributions. While AIS often performs well, it struggles to approximate multimodal distributions and suffers when applied to high dimensional problems. By contrast, VI is fast and scales well with the dimension, but typically underestimates the variance of the target distribution. In this paper, we combine both methods to overcome their individual drawbacks and create an efficient and robust novel technique for drawing better samples from a target distribution. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show how to do a smart initialization of AIS using VI. Second, we propose a method for adapting the parameters of the proposal distributions of the AIS, where the adaptation depends on the performance of the VI step. Computer simulations reveal that the new method improves the performance of the individual methods and shows promise to be applied to challenging scenarios.},

Even though the previous system provided a fast, accurate, and easy means of authentication, it employed noticeably audible probe signals to extract ear acoustic-features, signals which might interrupt user activities. To overcome this problem, this paper presents silent user authentication by employing inaudible signals in the place of audible signals for capturing ear acoustic-features. A comparative study using a number of audible and inaudible signals demonstrates that inaudible signals provide accurate authentication under the condition that the relative position of the earphone device against the ear canal is constant, which is a requirement for continuous user authentication. On the other hand, audible signals offer better accuracy when the earphone position changes, which is often the case in initial user authentication. This suggests the idea of a hybrid system that employs both audible and inaudible signals for, respectively, accurate initial authentication and user-friendly continuous authentication.},

  abstract = {Many signals of interest are well-approximated by sparse linear combinations of atomic signals from a dictionary. Equivalently, they are well-approximated by low-dimensional subspaces in a union of subspaces generated by the dictionary. A given sparsity level has an associated union of subspaces (UoS) generated by sparse combinations of correspondingly many atoms. When considering a sequence of sparsity levels, we have a sequence of unions of subspaces (SUoS) of increasing dimension. This paper considers the problem of learning such an SUoS from data. While each UoS is combinatorially large with respect to sparsity level, our learning approach exploits the fact that sparsity is structured for many signals of interest, i.e., that certain collections of atoms are more frequently used together than others. This is known as group sparsity structure and has been studied extensively when the structure is known a priori. We consider the setting where the structure is unknown, and we seek to learn it from training data. We also adapt the subspaces we obtain to improve representation and parsimony, similar to the goal of adapting atoms in dictionary learning. We illustrate the benefits of the learned dictionary-based SUoS for the problem of denoising; using a more parsimonious and representative SUoS results in improved recovery of complicated structures and edges.},

This method consists of finding the rotation of the two original directions of the magnetometers (North-South and East-West) that maximizes or, equivalently, minimizes, the value of a certain statistical parameter.

In these architectures, the coded aperture design is critical to obtain high-quality reconstructions. The structure of coded apertures is traditionally designed without information about the scene, but recently side information-based architectures provide prior information of the scene, which enables adaptive coded aperture designs. This work proposes the development of an adaptive coded aperture design for spectral imaging with the single pixel camera, based on a multi-resolution approach. An RGB side image is used to define blocks of similar pixels, such that they can be used to design the coded aperture patterns. This approach improves the reconstruction quality in up to 23dB compared with traditional single pixel camera, and the computation time in up to 99.5% because it does not require an iterative algorithm.},

The second one is the disagreement on the precise positions of beats in human annotations or the delay of annotations caused by human tapping. In order to tackle these problems, we propose to convolve the original ground truth with a Gaussian kernel as the target output of the network for a more robust training. We conduct a comparison experiment using five different Gaussian kernels on five individual datasets. The results on the validation sets show that we can train a better or at least competitive model in a shorter time by using the convolved ground truth with a proper Gaussian kernel.},

However, conventional classification pipelines that digitize the analog signals at Nyquist rate followed by digital feature extraction and classification are wasteful in a sense that the “feature rate” is generally much smaller than the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we propose a novel classification pipeline called analog-to-feature (A2F) conversion that directly acquires features in the analog domain using non-uniform wavelet sampling (NUWS). Our approach effectively combines Nyquist-rate sampling and digital feature extraction, which has the potential to significantly reduce the power and costs of signal classification. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for the detection of audio events and show that NUWS-based A2F conversion is able to outperform existing methods that use compressive sensing.},

  abstract = {Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) provides valuable knowledge to many areas. Recently, wearable devices have gained space as a relevant source of data. However, there are two issues: large number of heterogeneous sensors available and the temporal nature of the sensor data. To handle those issues, we propose a multimodal approach that processes each sensor separately and, through an ensemble of Deep Convolution Neural Networks (DCNN), extracts information from multiple temporal scales of the sensor data. In this ensemble, we use a convolutional kernel with a different height for each DCNN. Considering that the number of rows in the sensor data reflects the data captured over time, each kernel height reflects a temporal scale from which we can extract patterns. Consequently, our approach is able to extract from simple movement patterns such as a wrist twist when picking up a spoon to complex movements such as the human gait. This multimodal and multitemporal approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art works in seven important datasets using two different protocols. In addition, we demonstrate that the use of our proposed set of kernels improves sensor-based HAR in another multi-kernel approach, the widely employed inception network.},

Most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms for compressive speech sensing only exploit speech samples to construct the dictionary. In this paper, we propose to leverage both the speech signal and its linear prediction coefficients jointly to learn a structured and sparse dictionary. The proposed dictionary is designed based on a new optimization strategy using both l0 and l2 norms to enforce sparsity and structure, respectively. The resulting optimization problem can be solved by a fast iterative algorithm in two stages.

  abstract = {Due to a wider diversification of gas sources, today tracking gas in distribution grids is of great interest for gas grid operators to provide fair invoicing of gas customers. Substitute natural gas (SNG), e.g. derived from raw biogas, injected concurrently into natural gas grids may differ in its calorific value Hs compared to fossil natural gas in the grid. This is manifesting in deviating chemical compositions of injected grid gases. Remarkably, the chemical fractions of SNGs fluctuate significantly over time exhibiting time-dependent signatures. Sampling over relevant features of injected gases, e.g. the chemical species concentrations at standard temperature and pressure, by means of calibrated sensors, provides time-dependent signals which can be taken for gas tracking purposes. To that end, we present an accurate technique to estimate the transit times of gas between nodes, e.g. from an entry to an exit point. As a result, calorific value extrapolation from one gas grid node to a downstream node, with an accuracy sufficient for gas customer invoicing, is feasible. In an experimental section we show a normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) with respect to calorific value estimation.},

If the importance function, also called proposal, does a satisfactory job, the particles of the filter are placed in parts where the explored state space has high probability mass. Further, the weights of these particles are not too disparate in values. An important class of particle filtering that uses a clever approach to create good importance functions is known as auxiliary particle filtering. In this paper, we first analyze the approximations used for computing the particle weights of the standard auxiliary particle filter. We show that these approximations can be detrimental to the performance of the auxiliary particle filter. Further, we propose a more comprehensive evaluation of the weights, which leads to a much enhanced performance of the auxiliary particle filter. We also demonstrate the improvements with computer simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method of anomalous sound event detection for use in public spaces. The proposed method utilizes WaveNet, a generative model based on a convolutional neural network, to model in the time domain the various acoustic patterns which occur in public spaces. When the model detects unknown acoustic patterns, they are identified as anomalous sound events. WaveNet has been used to precisely model a waveform signal and to directly generate it using random sampling in generation tasks, such as speech synthesis. On the other hand, our proposed method uses WaveNet as a predictor rather than a generator to detect waveform segments causing large prediction errors as unknown acoustic patterns. Because WaveNet is capable of modeling detailed temporal structures, such as phase information, of the waveform signals, the proposed method is expected to detect anomalous sound events more accurately than conventional methods based on reconstruction errors of acoustic features. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct an experimental evaluation using a real-world dataset recorded in a subway station. We compare the proposed method with the conventional feature-based methods such as an auto-encoder and a long short-term memory network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods and that the prediction errors of WaveNet can be effectively used as a good metric for unsupervised anomalous detection.},

In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a “dedicated beam training” which serves only users under high mobility. Combined with conventional common beam training, the proposed dedicated beam training can allow the high mobility users to acquire channels with a small number of training beams exploiting the location information of the target user. The optimal selection of the training beams is formulated such that the lower bound of the angle of departure (AoD) estimate is minimized over the beam codebook indices given the estimate of the previous AoD state. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed beam training scheme can maintain good channel estimation performance with less training overhead than the conventional beam training protocol.},

The underlying idea of this method is to generate the optimal projection matrix by considering both the sparsity as well as the correlation of the data samples. The conventional L2-norm used in the objective function is sensitive to noise and outliers. Therefore, in this work Ll-norm is utilized as a robust alternative to L2-norm. Besides, for further improvement of the results, we use a penalty function of trace lasso with the LIGC method. It adaptively balances the L2-norm and Ll-norm simultaneously by considering the data correlation along with the sparsity. We obtain the optimal projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to within-class dispersion using Ll-norm with trace lasso as the penalty. Furthermore, an iterative procedure for this TL-LIGC method is proposed to solve the optimization function. The effectiveness of this proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark HSI datasets.},

  abstract = {This paper illustrates the improvement in accuracy of classification for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals measured during a memory encoding task, by using features based on a mean square error (MSE) optimal time-frequency estimator. The EEG signals are modelled as Locally Stationary Processes, based on the modulation in time of an ordinary stationary covariance function. After estimating the model parameters, we compute the MSE optimal kernel for the estimation of the Wigner-Ville spectrum. We present a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the derived optimal spectral estimator, compared to the single windowed Hanning spectrogram and the Welch spectrogram. Further, the estimation procedure is applied to the measured EEG and the time-frequency features extracted from the spectral estimates are used to feed a neural network classifier. Consistent improvement in classification accuracy is obtained by using the features from the proposed estimator, compared to the use of existing methods.},

  title = {Estimation of Missing Data in Fetal Heart Rate Signals Using Shift-Invariant Dictionary},
  year = {2018},
  pages = {762-766},
  abstract = {In 2015, an estimated 1.3 million intrapartum stillbirths occurred, meaning that the fetus died during labour. The majority of these stillbirths occurred in low and middle income countries. With the introduction of affordable continuous fetal heart rate (FHR) monitors for use in these settings, the fetal well-being can be better monitored and health care personnel can potentially intervene at an earlier time if abnormalities in the FHR signal are detected. Additional information about the fetal health can be extracted from the fetal heart rate signals through signal processing and analysis. A challenge is, however, the large number of missing samples in the recorded FHR as fetal and maternal movement in addition to sensor displacement can cause data dropouts. Previously proposed methods perform well on estimation of short dropouts, but struggle with data from wearable devices with longer dropouts. Sparse representation and dictionary learning have been shown to be useful in the related problem of image inpainting. The recently proposed dictionary learning algorithm, SI-FSDL, learns shift-invariant dictionaries with long atoms, which could be beneficial for such time series signals with large dropout gaps. In this paper it is shown that using sparse representation with dictionaries learned by SI-FSDL on the FHR signals with missing samples provides a reconstruction with improved properties compared to previously used techniques.},

  pages = {514-518},
  abstract = {Many papers have recently been published on image restoration and single-image super-resolution (SISR) using different deep neural network architectures, training methodology, and datasets. The standard approach for performance evaluation in these papers is to provide a single “average” mean-square error (MSE) and/or structural similarity index (SSIM) value over a test dataset. Since deep learning is data-driven, performance of the proposed methods depends on the size of the training and test sets as well as the variety and complexity of images in them. Furthermore, the performance varies across different images within the same test set. Hence, comparison of different architectures and training methods using a single average performance measure is difficult, especially when they are not using the same training and test sets. We propose new measures to characterize the variety and complexity of images in the training and test sets, and show that our proposed dataset complexity measures correlate well with the mean PSNR and SSIM values obtained on different test data sets. Hence, better characterization of performance of different methods is possible if the mean and variance of the MSE or SSIM over the test set as well as the size, resolution and complexity measures of the training and test sets are specified.},

We present two common estimation methods, namely the covariance-whitening (CW) and the covariance-subtraction (CS) methods. The CW method has been shown in prior work to outperform the CS method. However, thus far its performance has not been analyzed. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the CW and CS methods and show that in the cases of spatially white noise and of uniform powers of desired speech source and coherent interference over all microphones, the CW method is superior. The derivations are validated by comparing them to their empirical counterparts in Monte Carlo experiments. In fact, the CW method outperforms the CS method in all tested scenarios, although there may be rare scenarios for which this is not the case.},

  abstract = {Target detection embedded in a complex interference background such as jamming or strong clutter is an important problem in signal processing. Traditionally, statistical adaptive detection processes are built from a binary hypothesis test performing on a grid of steering vectors. This usually involves the estimation of the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix using i.i.d. samples assumed to be target-free. Moving from this paradigm, we exploit the fact that the interference (clutter and/orjammers) lies in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Hence, the matrix of concatenated samples can be modeled as a sum of low-rank matrices (union of subspaces containing interferences) plus a sparse matrix times a dictionary of steering-vectors (rep-resenting the targets contribution). Recovering this factorization from the observation matrix allows to build detection maps for each sample. To perform such recovery, we propose a generalized version of the robust subspace recovery via bi-sparsity pursuitalgorithm [1]. Experimental results on a real data set highlight the interest of the approach.},

Due to their large amount of data, efficient compression of light field content is of paramount importance for storage and delivery. Quality evaluation plays a major role in assessing the impact of compression on visual perception. In particular, subjective methodologies for light field quality assessment must be carefully designed to ensure reliable results. In this paper, we present and compare two different methodologies to evaluate visual quality of light field contents. Both methodologies allow users to interact with the content and to freely decide which viewpoints to visualize. However, in the second methodology a brief animation of the available viewpoints is presented prior to interaction in order to ensure the same experience for all subjects. The time and patterns of interaction of both methods are compared and analyzed through a rigorous analysis. Conclusions provide useful insights for selecting the most appropriate light field evaluation methodology.},

  abstract = {Modern binaural hearing aids (HAs) can collaborate wirelessly with each other as well as with other assistive (wireless) devices. This enables multi-microphone noise reduction over small wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) to increase the intelligibility under adverse conditions. In this work, we assume one of the HAs to serve as the fusion center (FC). The optimal beamforming strategy for processing the received data at the FC depends on the acoustic scene and physical constraints (e.g., the bit-rate for transmission to the FC), and might be frequency dependent. Selection of the optimal beamforming strategy, while satisfying rate constraints on the communication between the different devices is an important challenge in such setups. In this paper, we propose an operational rate-constrained beamforming system for optimal rate allocation and strategy selection across frequency. We show an example of the proposed framework, where both the algorithm selection as well as the required rates to transmit the necessary microphone signals are optimized using uniform quantizers, while minimizing the mean-square error (MSE) distortion measure. In contrast to a well-known (theoretically optimal) reference method based on remote source coding for two devices, the presented algorithm is practically implementable and only requires knowledge of joint signal statistics at the FC. Evaluations (based on simulation experiments) show clear improvement over other practically implementable strateuies.},

Any damage to myelin disrupts neuronal communication leading to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). There is no cure for MS. This is, in part, due to lack of an efficient method for myelin quantification during drug screening. In this study, an image analysis based myelin sheath detection method, DeepMQ, is developed. The method consists of a feature extraction step followed by a deep learning based binary classification module. The images, which were acquired on a confocal microscope contain three channels and multiple z-sections. Each channel represents either oligodendroyctes, neurons, or nuclei. During feature extraction, 26-neighbours of each voxel is mapped onto a 2D feature image. This image is, then, fed to the deep learning classifier, in order to detect myelin. Results indicate that 93.38 % accuracy is achieved in a set of fluorescence microscope images of mouse stem cell-derived oligodendroyctes and neurons. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study utilizing image analysis along with machine learning techniques to quantify myelination.},

Quality of service (QoS)-aware optimization is considered where the aim is to minimize transmission power of multiple-antenna base station under the QoS constraints of single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that symbol-level beamforming scheme proposed in the literature is not an effective design method for multi-group multicasting and modify it using rotated constellation approach in order to reduce transmission power. Proposed method enforces the known interference in a constructive manner such that the received symbol at each user is inside the correct decision region for any set of symbols. Hence, designed beamformers can be utilized throughout a transmission-frame rather than symbol-by-symbol basis. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented for the proposed design problem and closed-form update equations are derived for the steps of the ADMM algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method decreases the transmission power significantly compared to the conventional and symbol-level beamforming.},

Thanks to the proposed local binary features, this algorithm shows a high accuracy exceeding 99% when tested on a large dataset. In addition, it enjoys an attractive property that the computational cost of decision-making is independent from the complexity of the trained machine.

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of super-resolution (SR) image reconstruction from a set of totally aliased low resolution (LR) images with different unknown sub-pixel offsets. By assuming the translational motion model, a linear compact representation between the LR image spectrums and SR image spectrum, based on multi-coset sampling is provided. Based on this model, we formulate the joint estimation of the unknown shifts and SR image spectrum as a dictionary learning problem and alternating minimization approach is employed to solve this joint estimation. Two different approaches for obtaining the SR image; one based on estimated shifts and another based on estimate SR spectrum are described. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is the smaller matrix sizes to be handled during the computation; typically on the order of number of images and enhancement factors, and is completely independent on the actual dimensions of LR and SR images, hence requiring significantly lesser resources than the current state of the art approaches. Brief simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

  abstract = {Data fusion refers to the joint analysis of multiple datasets which provide complementary views of the same task. In this paper, the problem of jointly analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is considered. Analyzing both EEG and fMRI measurements is highly beneficial for studying brain function because these modalities have complementary spatiotemporal resolutions: EEG offers good temporal resolution while fMRI offers good spatial resolution. The fusion methods reported so far ignore the underlying multi-way nature of the data in at least one of the modalities and/or rely on very strong assumptions concerning the relation among the respective data sets. In this paper, these two points are addressed by adopting tensor models for both modalities and by following a soft coupling approach to implement the fused analysis. To cope with the subject variability in EEG, the PARAFAC2 model is adopted. The results obtained are compared against those of Parallel ICA and hard coupling alternatives in both simulated and real data. Our results confirm the superiority of tensorial methods over methods based on ICA. In scenarios that do not meet the assumptions underlying hard coupling, the advantage of soft coupled decompositions is clearly demonstrated.},

We propose enhancements to different feature extractors, along with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, to simultaneously improve classification accuracy and execution time during training and testing.

The multiscale CSP features achieve \pmb73.70±15.90% (mean± standard deviation across 9 subjects) classification accuracy that surpasses the state-of-the-art method [1], 70.6±14.70%, on the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset. The Riemannian covariance features outperform the CSP by achieving 74.27±15.5% accuracy and executing 9x faster in training and 4x faster in testing. Using more temporal windows for Riemannian features results in 75.47±12.8% accuracy with 1.6x faster testing than CSP.},

  abstract = {Omnidirectional images are spherical signals captured by cameras with 360-degree field of view. In order to be compressed using existing encoders, these signals are mapped to planar domain. A commonly used planar representation is the equirectangular one, which corresponds to a non uniform sampling pattern on the spherical surface. This particularity is not explored in traditional image compression schemes, which treat the input signal as a classical perspective image. In this work, we build a graph-based coder adapted to the spherical surface. We build a graph directly on the sphere. Then, to have computationally feasible graph transforms, we propose a ratedistortion optimized graph partitioning algorithm to achieve an effective trade-off between the distortion of the reconstructed signals, the smoothness of the signal on each subgraph, and the cost of coding the graph partitioning description. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms JPEG coding of planar equirectangular images.},

  abstract = {Discriminating mental states from brain signals is crucial for many applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Most of the studies relied on the feature extraction from the activity of single brain areas, thus neglecting the potential contribution of their functional coupling, or connectivity. Here, we consider spectral coherence and imaginary coherence to infer brain connectivity networks from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during motor imagery and resting states in a group of healthy subjects. By using a graph theoretic approach, we then extract the weighted node degree from each network and evaluate its ability to discriminate the two mental states as a function of the number of available observations. The obtained results show that the features extracted from spectral coherence networks outperform those obtained from imaginary coherence in terms of significant difference, neurophysiological interpretation and reliability with fewer observations. Taken together, these findings suggest that graph algebraic descriptors of brain connectivity networks can be further explored to classify mental states.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a system for rare sound event detection using a hierarchical and multi-scaled approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The task consists on detection of event onsets from artificially generated mixtures. Spectral features are extracted from frames of the acoustic signals, then a first event detection stage operates as binary classifier at frame-rate and it proposes to the second stage contiguous blocks of frames which are assumed to contain a sound event. The second stage refines the event detection of the prior network, discarding blocks that contain background sounds wrongly classified by the first stage. Finally, the effective onset time of the active event is obtained. The performance of the algorithm has been assessed with the material provided for the second task of the IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2017. The achieved overall error rate and F-measure, resulting respectively equal to 0.22 and 88.50 % on the evaluation dataset, significantly outperforms the challenge baseline and the system guarantees improved generalization performance with a reduced number of free network parameters w.r.t. other competitive algorithms.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves are polarized. Their polarization is essential to characterize the physical and dynamical properties of the source i.e., a coalescing binary of two compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars. Observations with two or more non coaligned detectors like Virgo and LIGO allow to reconstruct the two polarization components usually denoted by h+(t) and h×(t). The amplitude and phase relationship between the two components is related to the source orientation with respect to the observer. Therefore the evolution of the polarization pattern provides evidence for changes in the orientation due to precession or nutation of the binary. Usually, some specific direct dynamical model is exploited to identify the physical parameters of such binaries. Recently, a new framework for the time-frequency analysis of bivariate signals based on a quaternion Fourier transform has been introduced in [1]. It permits to analyze the bivariate signal combining h+(t) and h×(t) by defining its quaternion embedding as well as a set of non-parametric observables, namely Stokes parameters. These parameters are remarkably capable of measuring fine properties of the source, in particular by deciphering precession, without close bounds to a specific dynamical model.},

Increased tSNR and power spectral density in the resting-state frequency range (0.01-0.1 Hz) were found for all pre-processing pipelines with respect to the minimally pre-processed data, suggesting a positive gain in terms of temporal properties when optimal cleaning procedures are applied to the acquired fMRI data.

  abstract = {Road quality assessment is a key task in a city's duties as it allows a city to operate more efficiently. This assessment means a city's budget can be allocated appropriately to make sure the city makes the most of its usually limited budget. However, this assessment still relies largely on manual annotation to generate the Overall Condition Index (OCI) of a pavement stretch. Manual surveying can be inaccurate, while on the other side of the spectrum a large portion of automatic surveying techniques rely on expensive equipment (such as laser line scanners). To solve this problem, we propose an automated infrastructure assessment method that relies on street view images for its input and uses a spectrum of computer vision and pattern recognition methods to generate its assessments. We first segment the pavement surface in the natural image. After this, we operate under the assumption that only the road pavement remains, and utilize a sliding window approach using Fisher Vector encoding to detect the defects in that pavement; with labelled data, we would also be able to classify the defect type (longitudinal crack, transverse crack, alligator crack, pothole ... etc.) at this stage. A weighed contour map within these distressed regions can be used to identify exact crack and defect locations. Combining this information allows us to determine severities and locations of individual defects in the image. We use a manually annotated dataset of Google Street View images in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. We show promising results, achieving a 93% Fl-measure on crack region detection from perspective images.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an effective modelling of sound event spectra with a hidden data-size-imbalance, for improved Acoustic Event Detection (AED). The proposed method models each event as an aggregated representation of a few latent factors, while conventional approaches try to find acoustic elements directly from the event spectra. In the method, all the latent factors across all events are assigned comparable importance and complexity to overcome the hidden imbalance of data-sizes in event spectra. To extract latent factors in each event, the proposed method employs clustering and performs non-negative matrix factorization to each latent factor, and learns its acoustic elements as a sub-dictionary. Separate sub-dictionary learning effectively models the acoustic elements with limited data-sizes and avoids over-fitting due to hidden imbalances in training data. For the task of polyphonic sound event detection from DCASE 2013 challenge, an AED based on the proposed modelling achieves a detection F-measure of 46.5%, a significant improvement of more than 19% as compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

This restriction requires a special coding procedure to format the encrypted hidden data. This paper proposes a new set of embedding equations for pairwise RDH. The proposed approach inserts either one or two data bits into each pair based on its type, bypassing the need for special coding. The proposed equations can be easily integrated in most pairwise reversible data hiding frameworks.

  year = {2018},
  pages = {206-210},
  abstract = {With the rapid development of light field technology, depth estimation has been highlighted as one of the critical problems in the field, and a number of approaches have been proposed to extract the depth of the scene. However, depth estimation by stereo matching becomes difficult and unreliable when the captured images lack both color and feature information. In this paper, we propose a scheme that extracts robust depth from monochromatic, feature-sparse scenes recorded in orthographic sub-aperture images. Unlike approaches which rely on the rich color and texture information across the sub-aperture views, our approach is based on depth from focus techniques. First, we superimpose shifted sub-aperture images on top of an arbitrarily chosen central image. To focus on different depths, the shift amount is varied based on the micro-lens array properties. Next, an area-based depth estimation approach is applied to find the best match among the focal stack and generate the dense depth map. This process is repeated for each sub-aperture image. Finally, occlusions are handled by merging depth maps generated from different central images followed by a voting process. Results show that the proposed scheme is more suitable than conventional depth estimation approaches in the context of orthographic captures that have insufficient color and feature information, such as microscopic fluorescence imaging.},

  title = {Fast Convergence for Stochastic and Distributed Gradient Descent in the Interpolation Limit},
  year = {2018},
  pages = {1890-1894},
  abstract = {Modern supervised learning techniques, particularly those using deep nets, involve fitting high dimensional labelled data sets with functions containing very large numbers of parameters. Much of this work is empirical. Interesting phenomena have been observed that require theoretical explanations; however the non-convexity of the loss functions complicates the analysis. Recently it has been proposed that the success of these techniques rests partly in the effectiveness of the simple stochastic gradient descent algorithm in the so called interpolation limit in which all labels are fit perfectly. This analysis is made possible since the SGD algorithm reduces to a stochastic linear system near the interpolating minimum of the loss function. Here we exploit this insight by presenting and analyzing a new distributed algorithm for gradient descent, also in the interpolating limit. The distributed SGD algorithm presented in the paper corresponds to gradient descent applied to a simple penalized distributed loss function, L(w1, ..., wn) = Σili(wi) + μ Σ<;i,j><;/i,j> |wi - wj|2. Here each node holds only one sample, and its own parameter vector. The notation <; i, j > denotes edges of a connected graph defining the communication links between nodes. It is shown that this distributed algorithm converges linearly (ie the error reduces exponentially with iteration number), with a rate 1-η/nλmin(H) <; R <; 1 where λmin(H) is the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the sample covariance or the Hessian H. In contrast with previous usage of similar penalty functions to enforce consensus between nodes, in the interpolating limit it is not required to take the penalty parameter to infinity for consensus to occur. The analysis further reinforces the utility of the interpolation limit in the theoretical treatment of modern machine learning algorithms.},

In most compressed sensing applications, random projection matrices have been used but it has been shown that optimizing these projections can greatly improve the sparse signal reconstruction performance. An incoherent projection matrix can greatly reduce the recovery error for sparse signal reconstruction. With this motivation, we propose an algorithm for the construction of an incoherent projection matrix with respect to the designed equiangular tight frame (ETF) for reducing pairwise mutual coherence. The designed frame consists of a set of column vectors in a finite dimensional Hilbert space with the desired norm and reduced pairwise mutual coherence. The proposed method is based on updating ETF with inertial force and constructing incoherent frame and projection matrix using alternating minimization. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art projection matrix design algorithms via numerical experiments and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms.},

After face frontalization step, for facial expression representation and classification, we have employed both a traditional approach, by using hand-crafted features, namely local binary patterns, in combination with support vector machine classification and a relatively more recent approach based on convolutional neural networks. To evaluate the impact of face frontalization on facial expression recognition performance, we have conducted cross-pose, subject-independent expression recognition experiments using the BU3DFE database. Experimental results show that pose normalization improves the performance for cross-pose facial expression recognition. Especially, when local binary patterns in combination with support vector machine classifier is used, since this facial expression representation and classification does not handle pose variations, the obtained performance increase is significant. Convolutional neural networks-based approach is found to be more successful handling pose variations, when it is fine-tuned on a dataset that contains face images with varying pose angles. Its performance is further enhanced by benefiting from face frontalization.},

  abstract = {Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) is an appealing framework to infer the complexity of a model along with the parameters. To this aim, sampling or variational methods are often used for inference. However, these methods come with numerical disadvantages for large-scale data. An alternative approach is to relax the probabilistic model into a non-probabilistic formulation which yields a scalable algorithm. One limitation of BNP approaches can be the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling for inference. Small-variance asymptotic (SVA) approaches paves the way to much cheaper though approximate methods for inference by taking benefit from a fruitful interaction between Bayesian models and optimization algorithms. In brief, SVA lets the variance of the noise (or residual error) distribution tend to zero in the optimization problem corresponding to a MAP estimator with finite noise variance for instance. We propose such an SVA analysis of a BNP dictionary learning (DL) approach that automatically adapts the size of the dictionary or the subspace dimension in an efficient way. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {1835-1839},
  abstract = {In Cognitive Radio, spectrum sensing methods can be classified in three categories: temporal, frequential and hybrid (temporal and frequential) methods. Temporal methods require a long observation period; frequential and hybrid methods have a high calculation cost and they are very sensitive to frequency resolution. In very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and non-cooperative conditions, spectrum sensing methods present some limitations. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new blind strategy to detect the unoccupied spectral bands during a very short observation period. This new strategy is a temporal method based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of the received signal. Since the recurrence level in a communication signal is different from that of White Gaussian Noise, the detector can evaluate the recurrence level of the observed signal to detect the presence of a communication signal over a given spectral bandwidth. First, we estimate the three fundamental parameters of the recurrence matrix: the time delay parameter, the embedding dimension and the recurrence threshold. With these parameters, during a detection stage, the detector evaluates the recurrence level through the recurrence rate and compare it to a predetermined threshold estimated in absence of the signal of interest. The spectrum sensing based on RQA is very fast, free of frequency resolution issue and able to distinguish communication signal from a White Gaussian Noise. The results of our simulations prove the robustness of proposed RQA detector acting over limited number of samples and under very low SNR conditions.},

A number of counter-forensic tools have been developed as well in order to impede a correct analysis. Such tools are often very effective due to the vulnerability of multimedia forensics tools, which are not designed to work in an adversarial environment. In this scenario, developing forensic techniques capable of granting good performance even in the presence of an adversary aiming at impeding the forensic analysis, is becoming a necessity. This turns out to be a difficult task, given the weakness of the traces the forensic analysis usually relies on. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the advances made over the last decade in the field of adversarial multimedia forensics. We first consider the view points of the forensic analyst and the attacker independently, then we review some of the attempts made to simultaneously take into account both perspectives by resorting to game theory.

  abstract = {Polyphonic music transcription is a challenging problem, requiring the identification of a collection of latent pitches which can explain an observed music signal. Many state-of-the-art methods are based on the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) framework, which itself can be cast as a latent variable model. However, the basic NMF algorithm fails to consider many important aspects of music signals such as low-rank or hierarchical structure and temporal continuity. In this work we propose a probabilistic model to address some of the shortcomings of NMF. Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) provides a probabilistic interpretation of NMF and has been widely applied to problems in audio signal processing. Based on PLCA, we propose an algorithm which represents signals using a collection of low-rank dictionaries built from a base pitch dictionary. This allows each dictionary to specialize to a given chord or interval template which will be used to represent collections of similar frames. Experiments on a standard music transcription data set show that our method can successfully decompose signals into a hierarchical and smooth structure, improving the quality of the transcription.},

Increasing performance requirements are fulfilled by utilizing a dense deployment of low-power small cells in addition to existing macro cells.

These changes in the network architecture create the need for effective control mechanisms specifically designed for heterogeneous networks. Range expansion for small cells has been proposed and extensively researched to achieve load balancing between macro cells and small cells. In this work, we propose a decentralized approach for cell range expansion in small cell networks that in operation only requires very limited local interaction between neighboring cells.

  year = {2018},
  pages = {251-255},
  abstract = {Light field cameras capture information about the incoming light from multiple directions, going beyond classical capturing of light intensity performed by regular RGB cameras. This enables the computation of more accurate depth maps compared to stereo methods based on conventional cameras. However, the very small angular resolution of light field cameras limits their practical use in 3D applications. In this paper, we introduce for the first time in the literature the use of light field camera arrays, with the aim of improving the depth maps while providing a wide field of view. In this context, a novel algorithm for multi-stereo matching based on light field camera arrays is proposed. The disparity maps for the sub-aperture images are computed based on light field camera pairs using a novel multi-scale and multi-window stereo-matching algorithm. A global energy minimization based on belief propagation is proposed to regularize the results. The resulting depth maps are efficiently fused by means of k-means clustering. The proposed approach demonstrates very promising results for accurate 3D scene reconstruction and free navigation applications.},

The particular case of the Maximum Variety Portfolio is treated but the same improvements apply also in the other optimisation problems such as the Minimum Variance Portfolio. We assume that the most important information (or the latent factors) are embedded in correlated Elliptical Symmetric noise extending classical Gaussian assumptions. We propose here to focus on a recent method of model order selection allowing to efficiently estimate the subspace of main factors describing the market. This non-standard model order selection problem is solved through Random Matrix Theory and robust covariance matrix estimation. The proposed procedure will be explained through synthetic data and be applied and compared with standard techniques on real market data showing promising improvements.},

This paper aims to present a generalization of the quaternion dictionary learning method by using the octonion algebra. The octonion algebra combined with dictionary learning methods is well suited for representation of multispectral images with up to 7 color channels. Opposed to the classical dictionary learning techniques that treat multispectral images by concatenating spectral bands into a large monochrome image, we treat all the spectral bands simultaneously. Our approach leads to better preservation of color fidelity in true and false color images of the reconstructed multispectral image.

  abstract = {Integral or light field imaging is an attractive approach in microscopy, as it allows to capture 3D samples in just one shot and explore them later through changing the focus on particular depth planes of interest. However, it requires a compromise between spatial and angular resolution on the 2D sensor recording the microscopic images. A particular setting called Fourier Integral Microscope (FIMic) allows maximizing the spatial resolution for the cost of reducing the angular one. In this work, we propose a technique, which aims at reconstructing the continuous light field from sparse FIMic measurements, thus providing the functionality of continuous refocus on any arbitrary depth plane. Our main tool is the densely-sampled light field reconstruction in shearlet domain specifically tailored for the case of FIMic. The experiments demonstrate that the implemented technique yields better results compared to refocusing sparsely-sampled data.},

  abstract = {Computation caching is a novel strategy to improve the performance and the quality of service of mobile edge cloud networks. It consists in storing in local memories situated at the edge of the network, here mobile access points, the already processed results of computations that users offload to the mobile edge cloud. The goal of this technique is to avoid redundant and repetitive processing of the same tasks, thus streamlining the offloading process and improving the exploitation of both users' and network's resources. In this paper, three different computation caching policies are proposed and evaluated. They are based on three main parameters: the popularity of offloadable tasks, the size of their inputs, and the size of their results. Numerical simulations show that good policies need to take into account these three parameters altogether.},

  abstract = {With the rapid emergence of various 360 video capturing devices and head-mounted displays, providing immersive experience using 360 videos is becoming a topic of paramount interest. The current techniques face motion sickness issues, resulting in low quality of experience. One of the reason is that they do not take advantage of the parallax between the divergent views, which may be helpful to provide the correct view according to the user's head motion. In this paper, we propose to get rid of the classical ERP representation, and to synthesize arbitrary views using different divergent views together with their corresponding depths. Thus, we can exploit the parallax between the divergent views. In this context, we assess the feasibility of the depth estimation and the view synthesis using state-of-the-art techniques. Simulation results confirmed the feasibility of such a proposal, in addition to possibility to achieve sufficient visual quality for a head motion up to 0.1m from the rig, when using generated depth map for view synthesis.},

  abstract = {Millimeter wave (mm-Wave) communications are characterized by wideband channels with few directional paths, mostly in line-of-sight. Antenna arrays are mandatory to cope with severe path-loss, and the resulting channel response is sparse in the space-time (ST) domain. This paper addresses the sparsity by proposing a channel estimation method that exploits the algebraic structure of channel and interference, without requiring complex antenna-array calibration procedures. The method relies on the recognition that the ST channel is low-rank and exhibits slowly and fast-varying features (angles/delays of arrival and fading amplitudes, respectively) and, accordingly, that the interference has a slowly-varying spatial covariance with fast-varying amplitudes. The accuracy of the estimation of quasi-stationary components is increased by introducing averaging mechanisms over multiple sequences. Numerical results show that: i) rank-1 is an effective channel-interference representation in mm- Wave setting with severe interference; ii) fundamental limits (derived in closed form) prove the remarkable performance gains in terms of signal-to interference ratio; iii) circular array arrangement with directive elements is preferable compared to square or triangular configurations.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {1662-1666},
  abstract = {Here we introduce a noisy cGMM, a probabilistic model for noisy, mixed signals observed by a microphone array for joint source separation and denoising. In a conventional time-varying complex Gaussian mixture model (cGMM), the observed signals are assumed to be composed of sparse target signals only, where the sparseness refers to the property of having significant power at only a few time-frequency points. However, this assumption becomes inaccurate in the presence of non-sparse signals such as background noise, which renders speech enhancement based on the cGMM less effective. In contrast, the proposed noisy cGMM is based on the assumption that the observed signals consist of not only sparse target signals but also non-sparse background noise. This enables the noisy cGMM to model the observed signals accurately even in the presence of non-sparse background noise, which leads to effective speech enhancement. We also propose a joint diagonalization-based algorithm for estimating the model parameters of the noisy cGMM, which is significantly faster than the standard EM algorithm without any performance degradation. Indeed, the joint diagonalization bypasses the need for matrix inversion, matrix multiplication, and determinant computation at each time-frequency point, which are needed in the EM algorithm. In an experiment, the noisy cGMM outperformed the cGMM in joint source separation and denoising.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an effective classification method to differentiate between normal and abnormal lung sounds, which takes into account the detection level of heart sounds. Abnormal lung sounds frequently contain adventitious sounds; however, misclassification between heart sounds and adventitious sounds makes it difficult to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, the classification performance of conventional methods, which use the detection function of heart sounds, becomes worse for those lung sounds which contain a low level of heart sounds. To address this problem, our proposed method changes the classification method according to the detection rate of heart sounds, whereby if the rate was high, the heart-sound models in the HMM -based classification method were used. In addition to spectral information, temporal information of heart sounds and adventitious sounds were also used to obtain the rate more precisely. When using lung sounds from three auscultation points, the proposed method achieved a higher classification performance of 89.90% (between normal and abnormal respiration) compared to 88.7% for the conventional method, which used the detection function of heart sounds. Our approach to the classification of healthy and unhealthy subjects also achieved a higher classification rate of 86.6%, compared to 83.1 % when using the conventional method having the detection function of heart sounds.},

We address the derived privacy challenges in biometrics by a careful review of relevant aspects of the universal human rights from UN documents and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with a first identification and enumeration of relevant attributes. From the derived privacy sensitive attributes and respective requirements, de-identification approaches to protection of soft biometrics in face and fingerprints are explored.

  abstract = {Deep learning networks have been successfully applied to solve a large number of tasks. The effectiveness of deep learning networks is limited by the amount and the variety of data used for the training. For this reason, deep-learning networks can be applied in scenarios where a huge amount of data are available. In music information retrieval, this is the case of popular genres due to the wider availability of annotated music pieces. Instead, to find sufficient and useful data is a hard task for non widespread genres, like, for instance, traditional and folk music. To address this issue, Transfer Learning has been proposed, i.e., to train a network using a large available dataset and then transfer the learned knowledge (the hierarchical representation) to another task. In this work, we propose an approach to apply transfer learning for beat tracking. We use a deep BLSTM-based RNN as the starting network trained on popular music, and we transfer it to track beats of Greek folk music. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a dataset of Greek folk music, and we manually annotate the pieces.},

  abstract = {When signal coordination techniques can not eliminate all crosstalk in a digital subscriber line (DSL) system, competition for data rate among different users is strong. In such scenarios, employing a static resource allocation fails to capitalize on the time dependent nature of the traffic carried by the DSL network. An alternative approach is adaptive resource allocation, consisting of dividing time into slots of short duration and using a different resource allocation in each slot. A cross-layer scheduler then decides on the resource allocation for each time slot by solving a network utility maximization (NUM) problem. For many DSL systems however, this NUM problem is non-convex and solving it is NP-hard. This paper presents a fast algorithm for finding a local solution to the NUM problem, which is referred to as NUM-DSB. The algorithm is able to handle many DSL deployment scenarios, and is applicable regardless of the utility function's properties.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the optimisation of a sequence and its associated mismatched filter. This question has already been addressed in the literature, by alternatively solving two minimisation problem, one per sequence, meaning that the optimisation is never performed on both sequences at the same time. So, this article introduces some methods in order to optimise jointly (i.e. simultaneously) a sequence and its filter. First, a gradient descent is basically applied on both sequences. Second, another algorithm studies an objective function that includes the optimal mismatched filter that minimises the Integrated Sidelobe Level (or the Peak-to-Sidelobe Level Ratio). Simulations show promising results in terms of sidelobes: as expected, a joint optimisation seems to perform better than a separate one. As both methods behave differently, their choice will depend on the applications.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {1667-1671},
  abstract = {Here we propose an accelerated version of one of the most promising methods for audio source separation proposed by Duong et al. [“Under-determined reverberant audio source separation using a full-rank spatial covariance model,” IEEE Trans. ASLP, vol. 18, no. 7, pp. 1830-1840, Sep. 2010]. We refer to this conventional method as full-rank spatial covariance analysis (FCA), and the proposed method as FastFCA. A major drawback of the conventional FCA is computational complexity: inversion and multiplication of covariance matrices are required at each time-frequency point and each EM iteration. To overcome this drawback, the proposed FastFCA diagonalizes the covariance matrices jointly based on the generalized eigenvalue problem. This leads to significantly reduced computational complexity of the FastFCA, because the complexity of matrix inversion and matrix multiplication for diagonal matrices is O(M) instead of O(M3) (M: matrix order). Furthermore, the FastFCA is rigorously equivalent to the FCA, and therefore the reduction in computational complexity is realized without degradation in source separation performance. An experiment showed that the FastFCA was over 250 times faster than the FCA with virtually no degradation in source separation performance. In this paper, we focus on the two-source case, while the case of more than two sources is treated in a separate paper.},

  abstract = {A facial morph is a synthetically created image of a face that looks similar to two different individuals and can even trick biometric facial recognition systems into recognizing both individuals. This attack is known as face morphing attack. The process of creating such a facial morph is well documented and a lot of tutorials and software to create them are freely available. Therefore, it is mandatory to be able to detect this kind of fraud to ensure the integrity of the face as reliable biometric feature. In this work, we study the effects of face morphing on the physically correctness of the illumination. We estimate the direction to the light sources based on specular highlights in the eyes and use them to generate a synthetic map for highlights on the skin. This map is compared with the highlights in the image that is suspected to be a fraud. Morphing faces with different geometries, a bad alignment of the source images or using images with different illuminations, can lead to inconsistencies in reflections that indicate the existence of a morphing attack.},

Unfortunately, switching networks exhibit a noticeable energy leakage due to the time the array elements remain off, yielding a strong degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio. To improve the corresponding network efficiency, configurations with multiple switches per antenna element, or even with single-pole multiple-throw switches, have been proposed. However, network switching efficiency improvements sacrifice beamforming flexibility. To overcome such a limitation, recent works have proposed to replace the switches with variable-gain amplifiers controlled by time-variant pulses based exclusively on sinusoids. In this work, we describe a TMA architecture based on ultra-wide band analog multipliers which is suitable for all kind of periodic pulses.},

However, the enhancement quality reduces when the models are trained on data that is not highly relevant to a speech signal and a noise signal in a noisy observation. In this paper, we propose to train a classifier in order to overcome such poor characterization of the signals through the trained models. The main idea is to decompose the noisy observation into parts and the enhanced signal is reconstructed by combining the less-corrupted ones which are identified in the cepstral domain using the trained classifier. We apply unsupervised NMF followed by Wiener filtering for the decomposition, and use a support vector machine trained on the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients of the parts of training speech and noise signals for the classification. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the supervised NMF.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of sparse signal recovery for temporally correlated multiple measurement vectors (MMV) in a Bayesian framework. The temporal correlation of the sparse vector is modeled using a first order autoregressive process. In the case of time varying sparse signals, conventional tracking methods like Kalman filtering fail to exploit the sparsity of the underlying signal. Moreover, the computational complexity associated with sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) renders it infeasible even for moderately large datasets. To address this issue, we utilize variational approximation technique (which allows to obtain analytical approximations to the posterior distributions of interest even when exact inference of these distributions is intractable) to propose a novel fast algorithm called space alternating variational estimation with Kalman filtering (SAVE-KF). Similarly as for SAGE (space-alternating generalized expectation maximization) compared to EM, the component-wise approach of VB appears to allow to avoid a lot of bad local optima, explaining the better performance, apart from lower complexity. Simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm has a faster convergence rate and achieves lower mean square error (MSE) than other state of the art fast SBL methods for temporally correlated measurement vetors.},

This paper proposes a novel algorithm to detect short episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) using an ensemble framework. Several features are extracted from long term electrocardiogram (ECG) signals based on the heart rate variability (HRV). The most significant subset of features are selected as inputs to the four classifiers. Outputs of these classifiers are then combined for the final detection of the AF episodes. Results from an extensive analysis of the proposed algorithm show high classification accuracy (around 85 %) and sensitivity (around 92 %) for classifying very short episodes of AF (10 beats per segment, which is approximately 6 seconds). The accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed algorithm are improved significantly to 96.46 % and 94 %, respectively, for slightly longer episodes (60 beats per segment) of AF.

This research focuses on practical applications of BNNs to classify volcano-seismic signals using two variational learning approaches: Bayes by back-prop and Monte-Carlo dropout. We evaluate classification performance on seven classes of isolated events registered at “Volcán de Fuego”, Colima. Experimental results show an overall improvement for Monte-Carlo dropout approximation when compared to Bayes by backprop. Being at the intersection of Bayesian learning and geophysics, we demonstrate that BNNs provide uncertainty estimations when internal volcano-seismic sources change, which undoubtedly helps to enhance current early warning systems at volcanic observatories.},

  abstract = {Image morphing has proven to be very successful at deceiving facial recognition systems. Such a vulnerability can be critical when exploited in an automatic border control scenario. Recent works on this topic rely on dedicated algorithms which require additional software modules deployed alongside an existing facial recognition system. In this work, we address the problem of morphing detection by using state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms based on hand-crafted features and deep convolutional neural networks. We show that a general-purpose face recognition system combined with a simple linear classifier can be successfully used as a morphing detector. The proposed method reuses an existing feature extraction pipeline instead of introducing additional modules. It requires neither fine-tuning nor modifications to the existing recognition system and can be trained using only a small dataset. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on our morphing datasets using a 5-fold cross-validation.},

Results revealed that PTE was able to depict the performance and visualize the information flow better compared to the traditional techniques.

A hypothesis test is defined, where the null hypothesis represents the non-existence of the structure of interest in the true image. To determine if this null hypothesis is rejected, we use the data and prior knowledge. Computing such test in the context of imaging problem is often intractable due to the high dimensionality involved. In this work, we propose to leverage probability concentration phenomena and the underlying convex geometry to formulate the Bayesian hypothesis test as a convex minimization problem. This problem is subsequently solved using a proximal primal-dual algorithm. The proposed method is applied to astronomical radio-interferometric imaging.},

In some cases, such as medical imaging, the process of measuring the system matrix can be very time and memory consuming. Fortunately, the underlying physical relationships often have a sparse representation, and in such situations, compressed-sensing techniques may be used to predict the system matrix. However, since there may be systematic errors inside the predicted matrix, its inversion can cause significant noise amplification and large errors on the reconstructed quantities. To combat this, regularization methods are often applied. In this paper, based on the singular value decomposition, the minimum mean square error estimator, and Stein's unbiased risk estimate, we show how optimal regularization parameters can be obtained from a few number of measurements. The efficiency of our approach is shown for two different systems.},

This new model represents the distribution of matter in the universe much better than previously proposed models. We have developed a new algorithm that also takes into account the experimental problems we meet in practice, such as a non-diagonal covariance matrix of the noise or missing data. Experimental results on simulated data show that the proposed method exhibits improved estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed method uses connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as an end-to-end approach to directly convert a sequence of feature vectors of each sound event into a corresponding onomatopoeic word representation which accurately represents each sound and can be intuitively understood. Moreover, to address the issue of the ambiguity of onomatopoeic representations among different individuals, we develop a database of sound events and their corresponding typical onomatopoeic representations as accepted by multiple listeners. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct objective and subjective evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sound event encoder is capable of converting sound events into their onomatopoeic representations with a 74.5% subjective acceptability rating, and that use of typical onomatopoeic representations, as approved by multiple subjects, yields significant improvement, resulting in an acceptability rate of 81.8%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel sparsity based framework is proposed for accurate spatial sound field reproduction in spherical harmonic domain. The proposed framework can effectively reduce the number of loudspeakers required to reproduce the desired sound field using higher order ambisonics (HOA) over a fixed listening area. Although H OA provides accurate reproduction of spatial sound, it has a disadvantage in terms of the restriction on the area of sound reproduction. This area can be increased with the increase in the number of loudspeakers during reproduction. In order to limit the use of a large number of loudspeakers the sparse nature of the weight vector in the HOA signal model is utilized in this work. The problem of obtaining the weight vector is first formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is difficult to solve due to orthogonality property of the spherical harmonic matrix. This problem is therefore reformulated to exploit the sparse nature of the weight vector. The solution is then obtained by using the Bregman iteration method. Experiments on sound field reproduction in free space using the proposed sparsity based method are conducted using loudspeaker arrays. Performance improvements are noted when compared to least squares and compressed sensing methods in terms of sound field reproduction accuracy, subjective, and objective evaluations.},

We consider the problem of a bandlimited graph signal estimation (denoising) from single-bit samples obtained at each graph node. The samples before quantization are affected by zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise of known variance. Using Banach's contraction mapping theorem on complete metric spaces, we develop a recursive algorithm for bandlimited graph signal estimation. For our recursive algorithm, we show that the expected mean-squared error between the graph signal and its estimate is proportional to the bandwidth of the signal and inversely proportional to the size of the graph. We also consider the problem of choosing the nodes to sample based on the properties of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to minimize the mean-squared error of the estimate.

In contrast to previously proposed ML-based reverberation time estimators, the RT estimate is obtained by a simple closed-form expression, which leads to significant computational savings. Moreover, it is shown that the new estimator is unbiased and reaches the Crámer-Rao lower bound. The proposed RT estimator achieves a similar estimation accuracy but involves a significantly lower computational complexity compared to an ML-based RT estimator that scored among the best at the ACE Challenge.},

Sparse approximation algorithms that allow constraints on the approximation error do not perform well when the decomposition bases are redundant. This study puts in evidence some of the shortcomings of sparse approximation algorithms when dealing with unions of highly correlated bases, a case that currently lacks of a comprehensive mathematical analysis, and proposes solutions to mitigate them.

Most traditional design approaches can not control with enough accuracy the frequency response of the designed filter. For this reason, we propose the use of a memetic algorithm along with a weighted fitness function, to estimate optimized filter coefficients that best approximate ideal specifications. Results have been compared to both traditional methods (mainly windowing and the Parks-McClellan algorithm) as well as to several bio-inspired techniques. Numerical results show that proposed method achieves better fit to filter specifications, a larger attenuation in the stop band and a narrower transition band, at the expense of slightly increasing the passband ripple (0.5 - 0.7 dB), the later in about 68% of the cases.},

  abstract = {The goal of speech enhancement is to reduce the noise signal while keeping the speech signal undistorted. Recently we developed the multichannel Kalman filtering (MKF) for speech enhancement, in which the temporal evolution of the speech signal and the spatial correlation between multichannel observations are jointly exploited to estimate the clean signal. In this paper, we extend the previous work to derive a parametric MKF (PMKF), which incorporates a controlling factor to achieve the trade-off between the speech distortion and noise reduction. The controlling factor weights between the speech distortion and noise reduction related terms in the cost function of PMKF, and based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion, the optimal PMKF gain is derived. We analyse the performance of the proposed PMKF and show the differences with the speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filter (SDW-MWF). We conduct experiments in different noisy conditions to evaluate the impact of the controlling factor on the noise reduction performance, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {2100-2104},
  abstract = {We propose a non-parallel voice-conversion (VC) method that can learn a mapping from source to target speech without relying on parallel data. The proposed method is particularly noteworthy in that it is general purpose and high quality and works without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from non-parallel data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss can bring the converted speech close to the target one on the basis of indistinguishability without explicit density estimation. This allows to avoid over-smoothing caused by statistical averaging, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods that represent data distribution explicitly. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra, which are structural indicators highly correlated with subjective evaluation. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based parallel VC method even though CycleGAN-VC is trained under disadvantageous conditions (non-parallel and half the amount of data).},

  abstract = {Unsupervised representation learning shows high promise for generating robust features for acoustic scene analysis. In this regard, we propose and investigate a novel combination of features learnt using both a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and a recurrent sequence to sequence autoencoder (S2SAE). Each of the representation learning algorithms is trained individually on spectral features extracted from audio instances. The learnt representations are: (i) the activations of the discriminator in case of the DCGAN, and (ii) the activations of a fully connected layer between the decoder and encoder units in case of the S2SAE. We then train two multilayer perceptron neural networks on the DCGAN and S2SAE feature vectors to predict the class labels. The individual predicted labels are combined in a weighted decision-level fusion to achieve the final prediction. The system is evaluated on the development partition of the acoustic scene classification data set of the IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2017). In comparison to the baseline, the accuracy is increased from 74.8 % to 86.4 % using only the DCGAN, to 88.5 % on the development set using only the S2SAE, and to 91.1 % after fusion of the individual predictions.},

A rational criterion based on a least-squares fitting penalized with a suitable approximation of 10 is minimized using a recent approach guaranteeing global optimality for rational optimization.

Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) Golay codes have been implemented in a large number of imaging methods, and their ability to increase the image quality is already proven. In this paper we propose an improvement of the BPSK modulation, where the effect of the narrow-band ultrasound probe, used for acquisition, is compensated. The optimized excitation signals are implemented in a Plane Wave Compounding (PWC) imaging approach. Simulation and experimental results are presented. Numerical studies show 41% improvement of axial resolution and bandwidth, over the classical BPSK modulated Golay codes. Experimental acquisitions on cyst phantom show an improvement of image resolution of 32%. The method is also compared to classical pulse (small wave packets) emission and 25% boost of resolution is achieved for a 6dB higher echo signal to noise ratio. The experimental results obtained using UlaOp 256 prove the feasibility of the method on a research scanner while the theoretical formulation shows that the optimization of the excitation signals can be applied to any binary sequence and does not depend on the emission/reception beamforming.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {81-85},
  abstract = {In ultrasound imaging, a straightforward way of increasing axial resolution is by shortening the transmitted signals. However, short excitation provide low echo signal to noise ratio (eSN R), which results in low image quality. An alternate solution would be to increase the excitation signal's duration (by using binary Golay codes or chirps), and rely on off-line match filtering techniques in order to compress the received echoes. Resolution Enhancement Compression (REC) is a coding technique that provides better axial resolution than conventional pulsing technique while increasing the eSNR. It consists on designing a pre-enhanced chirp that compensates the most attenuated frequency bands of the ultrasound probe. The objective of this study is to combine orthogonal binary codes with REC pre-enhanced chirps in order to boost further the eSNR provided by REC while keeping its good performance in axial resolution. The method is applied to diverging wave compounding. Pairs of diverging waves are transmitted/received/reconstructed simultaneously thanks to the orthogonality property of the Golay codes. The results show that the proposed method is able to obtain a better image quality than conventional pulse imaging. The axial resolution and the bandwidth was improved by 38%/15% in simulation/experiment, for an excitation signal designed to provide a 39% boost. The contrast to noise ratio and the eSNR were improved by 3.5dB and 18.7dB respectively. Acquisition results suggest that the combination between binary codes and modulated enhanced chirps can be implemented in ultrasonic imaging system.},

  abstract = {Touch-based behavioural biometrics is an emerging technique for passive and transparent user authentication on mobile devices. It utilises dynamics mined from users' touch actions to model behaviour. The interaction of the user with the mobile device using touch is an important aspect to investigate as the interaction errors can influence the stability of sample donation and overall performance of the implemented biometric authentication system. In this paper, we are outlining a data collection framework for touch-based behavioural biometric modalities (signature, swipe and keystroke dynamics) that will enable us to study the influence of environmental conditions and body movement on the touch-interaction. In order to achieve this, we have designed a multi-modal behavioural biometric data capturing application “Touchlogger” that logs touch actions exhibited by the user on the mobile device. The novelty of our framework lies in the collection of users' touch data under various usage scenarios and environmental conditions.

The acoustic user interface of such applications should be capable of detecting insufficient alignment results and identifying the responsible input utterances. In this paper, we discuss the automatic validation of speech alignment and propose two new validation algorithms. The first method relies on locating and matching the syllable nuclei of the aligned utterances. The second method performs syllable-level comparison of the speech signal envelopes in accordance to the alignment time-warping path. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms perform consistently well and can be effectively applied for the validation of different speech alignment methods.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a concept of Active Content Fingerprinting based on a Latent data Representation (aCFP-LR). The idea is to represent the data content by a constrained redundant description. The target is to estimate latent representation such that: (i) after applying a reconstructor function the result is close to the original data and (ii) after using an extraction function the resulting features are robust. A general problem formulation is proposed for aCFP-LR with an extractor-reconstructor pair of constraints. One particular case is considered under linear extractor (generator) and linear reconstructor (modulator) where a reduction is shown to a constrained projection problem. Evaluation by numerical experiments is given using local image patches, extracted from publicly available data sets. Advantages and state-of-the-art performance is demonstrated under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), lossy JPEG compression and projective geometrical transform distortions.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, we have proposed a novel approach for measuring the room impulse response (RIR) robust toward the nonlinearities affecting the power amplifier or the loudspeaker. The approach is implemented by modeling the acoustic path as a Legendre nonlinear (LN) filter and by measuring the first-order kernel using perfect periodic sequences (PPSs) and the cross-correlation method. PPSs are periodic sequences that guarantee the perfect orthogonality of the basis functions of a certain nonlinear filter over a period. For LN filters, PPSs have approximately a uniform distribution. We have shown that also the Wiener Nonlinear (WN) filters, which derive from the truncation of the Wiener series, admit PPSs, whose sample distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution. Thus, WN filters and their PPSs appear more appealing for measuring the RIR. The paper discusses RIR measurement using WN filters and PPSs and explains how PPSs for WN filter suitable for RIR identification can be developed. Experimental results, using signals affected by real nonlinear devices, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and compare it with that based on LN filters.},

  abstract = {Steered Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) is a novel framework for approximating multidimensional image modalities. Our goal is to provide full Six Degrees-of-Freedom capabilities for camera captured content. Previous research concerned only limited translational movement for which the 4D light field representation is sufficient. However, our goal is to arrive at a representation that allows for unlimited translational-rotational freedom, i.e. our goal is to approximate the full 5D plenoptic function. Until now, SMoE was only applied on Euclidean spaces. However, the plenoptic function contains two spherical coordinate dimensions. In this paper, we propose a methodology to extend the SMoE framework to spherical dimensions. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce the parameter space to the same two dimensional Euclidean space as for planar 2D images by using a projection of the covariance matrices onto tangent spaces perpendicular to the unit sphere. Finally, we propose a novel training technique for spherical dimensions based on these observations. Experiments performed on omnidirectional 360° images show that the introduction of the dimensionality-reduction projection step results in very low quality loss.},

This problem, referred to as material decomposition, can be formulated as a nonlinear inverse problem. In previous work, we proposed to decompose the projection images using a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm. To reduce further the ill-posedness of the problem, we propose here to consider equality and inequality constraints that are based on physical priors. In particular, we impose the positivity of the solutions as well the total mass in each projection image. In practice, we first decompose the projection images for each projection angle independently. Then, we reconstruct the sample slices from the decomposed projection images using a standard filtered-back projection algorithm. The constrained material decomposition problem is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We compare the proposed ADMM algorithm to the unconstrained Gauss-Newton algorithm in a numerical thorax phantom. Including constraints reduces the cross-talk between materials in both the decomposed projections and the reconstructed slices.},

A solution to this problem is investigated, which employs an efficient beamforming-based spectral distance response algorithm for both localization and enhancement of the source. The beamforming relies on a diagonal unloading (DU) transformation.

The array is positioned slightly above the plane of propellers, and centered with respect to the drone body. The experimental results conducted in stable hovering conditions are illustrated, and the localization and signal enhancing performances are reported under various noise conditions and source characteristics.},

However, apart from the fact that the skeleton data are contaminated with high frequency noise, the major drawback lies in the inability to retain the antropometric properties, like the body segments' length, which varies with time during the tracking. In this paper, a particle filter based approach has been proposed to track the human skeleton data in the presence of high frequency noise and multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to reduce the bone length variations. In our approach multiple segments in skeleton are filtered simultaneously and segments' lengths are preserved by considering their interconnection unlike other methods in available literature. The proposed algorithm has achieved MAPE of 3.44% in maintaining the body segment length close to the ground truth and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

The enhanced SRP-DU is obtained by weighting the frequency components with respect to the spectral characteristics of the speaker. The approach does not add significant computational load to the array processing. Experiments conducted in noisy and reverberant conditions show that the use of the DU beamformer provides better speaker recognition performance if compared to the conventional one since it reduces deleterious effects due to the spatially white noise and point-source interferences. Simulations also show that the speaker identification can improve the localization accuracy, and it is thus interesting for applications and systems which rely on Intearated localization and speaker identification.},

  abstract = {Arbitrary sampling rate conversion (ASRC) of audio signals currently receives a lot of new attention due to its potential for aligning autonomous recording clients in ad-hoc acoustic sensor networks. State-of-the-art for digital-to-digital ASRC has been outlined in terms of a two-stage architecture comprising a) synchronous lowpass interpolation by an integer factor and b) subsequent asynchronous polynomial interpolation. While this composite ASRC achieves high resampling accuracy, its mere disadvantage is the intermediate oversampling to high rate. In our paper we thus fuse the high-rate discrete-time lowpass interpolation with a polynomial Farrow filter into a monolithic FIR filter form. We then show that decimation of the output rate effectively yields a polyphase set of Farrow filters with quasi-fixed coefficients. Simulations with broadband multitone signals confirm that the proposed low-rate monolithic ASRC achieves the same performance as the conventional composite resampling in terms of signal-to-interpolation-noise ratio. The main practical benefit of quasi-fixed coefficients of the system stands out when resampling by a small factor is desired, i.e., when the input rate almost matches the output rate - a scenario to be encountered in acoustic sensor networks.},

  abstract = {Some applications require video content to be encoded and uploaded to a remote destination in a fixed time. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge, based on online adaptation of compression parameters to control both encoding and uploading time. In particular, an algorithm to accurately predict the encoding time and bit-rate resulting from using a given quantisation parameter to encode the next frames in the sequence is proposed. This is used to drive decisions during the encoding process, to maintain the cumulative time needed to encode and transmit the video sequence within the constraints. Experimental evaluation shows that when using the proposed method, time constraints can be met with high accuracy under a variety of different target times and bandwidth conditions.},

  pages = {558-562},
  abstract = {Behavioural biometrics looks at discriminative features of a person's measurable behaviour, which is known to show high variance over long stretches of time. In psychology, a significant portion of this behavioural variance is explained by an individual improving their skill at performing behaviours, mostly through practice. Understanding what the effects of practice are on biometric recognition performance should allow us to account for much of this variance, as well as make individual behavioural biometric studies easier to compare [15]. We hypothesize that more accumulated practice will lead to both more stable and increased recognition performance. We argue that these are significant effects and show that practice in general is under-investigated. We introduce a novel method of analysis, the Start-to-Train Interval (STI)/Train-to-Test Interval (TTI) contour plot, which allows for systematic investigation of how recognition performance develops under increased practice. We applied this method to three data sets of a Discrete Sequence Production (DSP) task, a task that consists of repeatedly (500+ times) typing in a simple password, and found that more practice both significantly increases recognition performance and makes it more stable. These findings call for further investigation into the effects of practice on recognition performance for more standard behavioural biometric paradigms.},

  abstract = {Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over Wi-Fi, Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the recorded data.},

  pages = {992-996},
  abstract = {The amount of time an infant cries in a day helps the medical staff in the evaluation of his/her health conditions. Extracting this information requires a cry detection algorithm able to operate in environments with challenging acoustic conditions, since multiple noise sources, such as interferent cries, medical equipments, and persons may be present. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting infant cries in such environments. The proposed solution is a multiple stage detection algorithm: the first stage is composed of an eight-channel filter-and-sum beamformer, followed by an Optimally Modified Log-Spectral Amplitude estimator (OMLSA) post-filter for reducing the effect of interferences. The second stage is the Deep Neural Network (DNN) based cry detector, having audio Log-Mel features as inputs. A synthetic dataset mimicking a real neonatal hospital scenario has been created for training the network and evaluating the performance. Additionally, a dataset containing cries acquired in a real neonatology department has been used for assessing the performance in a real scenario. The algorithm has been compared to a popular approach for voice activity detection based on Long-Term Spectral Divergence, and the results show that the proposed solution achieves superior detection performance both on synthetic data and on real data.},

  abstract = {This work concerns the construction of articulatory models for synthesis of speech, and more specifically the velum and epiglottis. The direct application of principal component analysis to the contours of these articulators extracted from MRI images results in unrealistic factors due to delineation errors. The approach described in this paper relies on the application of PCA to the centerline of the articulator and a simple reconstruction algorithm to obtain the global articulator contour. The complete articulatory model was constructed from static Magnetic Resonance (MR) images because their quality is much better than that of dynamic MR images. We thus assessed the extent to which the model constructed from static images is capable of approaching the vocal tract shape in MR images recorded at 55 Hz for continuous speech. The analysis of reconstruction errors shows that it is necessary to add dynamic images to the database of static images, in particular to approach the tongue shape for the /I/sound.},

In the estimation process, several examples, i.e. a set of pels whose neighborhoods are similar to a local texture of the target pel to be encoded, are gathered from a search window located on an already encoded part of the same image. Then the probability distribution is modeled as a weighted sum of the Gaussian functions whose center positions are given by the individual examples. Furthermore, model parameters that control shapes of the Gaussian functions are numerically optimized so that the resulting coding rate of the image intensity values can be a minimum. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides comparable coding performance to the state-of-the-art lossless coding schemes proposed by other researchers.},

Then, superpixel adjacency is used to improve the boundaries. Finally, a rolling circle filter is applied to the segmentation to generate a mask that covers the area of contact. The procedure is carried out on a sequence of images captured in an automatic test machine. The estimated shape and total area of contact are built by averaging all the masks that have computed throughout the sequence. Since a ground-truth is not available, we also propose a comparative method to assess the performance of our proposal.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {156-160},
  abstract = {In modern video codecs, such as HEVC and VP9, intra-frame blocks are decorrelated using DCT or DST. The optimal separable transform for intra prediction residual blocks has been determined to be a hybrid transform composed of the DCT and the odd type-3 DST (ODST-3), independent of block size. However, the ODST-3 has no fast algorithm like the DCT. Hence its use in HEVC and VP9 has been limited to only 4×4 blocks. For larger blocks such as 8×8 or 16×16, HEVC replaces the optimal ODST-3 with the conventional DCT while VP9 replaces it with the even type-3 DST (EDST-3), both of which have fast algorithms. The EDST-3 has better coding gain than the DCT but it has still a coding gain loss with respect to the optimal ODST-3. This paper attempts to optimize some parameters of the EDST-3 to reduce this coding gain loss while still retaining the fast algorithm. In particular, the 8-point EDST-3 is represented as a cascade of Givens rotations and some rotation angles are optimized to reduce the coding gain loss with respect to the optimal 8-point ODST-3. By replacing only the 8-point EDST-3 in VP9 with this optimized transform, while leaving other transforms with different sizes unchanged, average Bjontegaard-Delta bitrate savings of -0.13% are achieved with respect to the standard VP9 codec.},

  abstract = {We propose a regularized nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) model for multi-channel speech derestriction that incorporates prior knowledge about clean speech. The approach models the problem as recovering a signal convolved with different room impulse responses, allowing the dereverberation problem to benefit from microphone arrays. The factorization learns both individual reverberation filters and channel-specific delays, which makes it possible to employ an ad-hoc microphone array with heterogeneous sensors (such as multi-channel recordings by a crowd) even if they are not synchronized. We integrate two prior-knowledge regularization schemes to increase the stability of dereverberation performance. First, a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) inner routine is introduced to inform the original NTF problem of the pre-trained clean speech basis vectors, so that the optimization process can focus on estimating their activations rather than the whole clean speech spectra. Second, the NMF activation matrix is further regularized to take on characteristics of dry signals using sparsity and smoothness constraints. Empirical dereverberation results on different simulated reverberation setups show that the prior-knowledge regularization schemes improve both recovered sound quality and speech intelligibility compared to a baseline NTF approach.},

This is usually done by solving an optimization problem depending on a data fit term and a suitable regularizer. In this paper we consider feature maps which are the concatenation of a fixed, possibly large, set of simpler feature maps. The penalty is a sparsity inducing one, promoting solutions depending only on a small subset of the features. The group lasso problem is a special case of this more general setting. We show that one of the most popular optimization algorithms to solve the regularized objective function, the forward-backward splitting method, allows to perform feature selection in a stable manner. In particular, we prove that the set of relevant features is identified by the algorithm after a finite number of iterations if a suitable qualification condition holds.

One widely used approach for dealing with the signal reconstruction problem was proposed by Griffin and Lim. This method usually requires many iterations for the signal reconstruction process and depending on the inputs, it does not always produce high-quality audio signals. To overcome these shortcomings, we apply a learning-based approach to the signal reconstruction problem by modeling the signal reconstruction process using a deep neural network and training it using the idea of a generative adversarial network.

  abstract = {Moving target classification is a key ingredient to avoid accident in autonomous driving systems. Recently, fast chirp frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar has been popularly used to recognize moving targets due to its ability to discriminate moving objects and stationary clutter. In order to protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists, it is essential to identify road users in a very short period of time. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that consists of convolutional recurrent units for target classification in automotive radar system. In our experiment, using the real data measured by the fast chirp FMCW-based high range resolution radar, we show that the proposed network is capable of learning the dynamics in time-series image data and outperforms the conventional classification schemes.},

  abstract = {In network testing, identifying the cause for an observed speech quality degradation is of special interest. Common speech codec related causes to be identified are the application of a low bitrate or the occurrence of transcoding or self-tandem. This paper presents two comprehensible types of signal features which enable a speech-quality-motivated bitrate detection for the AMR-WB codec. The first type of feature is based on codec linearity, while the second type exploits the different structure of the fixed codebook at each bitrate. With these underlying features, the bitrate detection is performed with high accuracy. Since the one feature gathers information on the last applied bitrate and the other on coding effects accumulated during the entire transmission, this paper, additionally, provides a method to extract information on the occurrence of self-tandem in the network-under-test.},

The first amalgamates an ensemble of information collected from two types of convolutional operations, with differing kernel dimension on the frequency axis and equal dimension on the time axis. Secondly, the dependencies within the convolutional layer channel axes are learnt, by feeding channel slices into a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer. By taking this approach, convolutional layers can be connected to sequential models without the use of fully connected layers. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods delivered to INTERPEECH 2017 ComParE Snoring sub-challenge, our method ranks 5th on performance of test data. Moreover, we are the only competitor to train a deep learning model solely on the provided training data, except for Baseline. The performance of our model exceeds the baseline too much.},

  abstract = {Image quality assessment is an important field in different computer vision applications. A plethora of metrics has been proposed in the literature to answer this request. In this paper, we propose an image quality framework without reference based on selection of saliency patches and Convolutional Neural Network. The idea is here to not consider all patches of the distorted image but rather some of them, which are considered as the more perceptually relevant and thus impact more the Mean Opinion Score of the image. To do that, we first compute the saliency map of the distorted image. A scanpath prediction method, that aims to reproduce the visual behavior, is then applied to select the more relevant patches. A Convolutional Neural Network model is finally used to predict the quality score. Its input is the selected patches, while its output is the predicted Mean Opinion Score. The proposed was evaluated using four well-known datasets (LIVE-P2, TID 2008, TID 2013 and CSIQ). The results obtained show its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is a highly effective machine learning technique for large-scale problems. The optimization of nonconvex functions in deep learning literature is typically restricted to the class of first-order algorithms. These methods rely on gradient information because of the computational complexity associated with the second derivative Hessian matrix inversion and the memory storage required in large scale data problems. The reward for using second derivative information is that the methods can result in improved convergence properties for problems typically found in a non-convex setting such as saddle points and local minima. In this paper we introduce TRMinATR - an algorithm based on the limited memory BFGS quasi-Newton method using trust region - as an alternative to gradient descent methods. TRMinATR bridges the disparity between first order methods and second order methods by continuing to use gradient information to calculate Hessian approximations. We provide empirical results on the classification task of the MNIST dataset and show robust convergence with preferred generalization characteristics.},

  abstract = {The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of the sound sources has been a popular signal processing research topic due to its widespread applications. Using spherical microphone array, DOA estimation can be applied in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain without any spatial ambiguity. However, the environment reverberation and noise can degrade the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative stochastic maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm for DOA estimation of multiple sound sources in the presence of spatially nonuniform noise in the SH domain. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is considering the general model of the received signal in the SH domain. We reduce the complexity of the ML estimation by breaking it down to two separate problems: noise parameters and DOA estimation problems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the robustness of estimation, i.e, the root mean square error, by at least 7dB compared to the recent methods in the reverberant and noisy environments.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel, generic active learning method for one-class classification. Active learning methods play an important role to reduce the efforts of manual labeling in the field of machine learning. Although many active learning approaches have been proposed during the last years, most of them are restricted on binary or multi-class problems. One-class classifiers use samples from only one class, the so-called target class, during training and hence require special active learning strategies. The few strategies proposed for one-class classification either suffer from their limitation on specific one-class classifiers or their performance depends on particular assumptions about datasets like imbalance. Our proposed method bases on using two one-class classifiers, one for the desired target class and one for the so-called outlier class. It allows to invent new query strategies, to use binary query strategies and to define simple stopping criteria. Based on the new method, two query strategies are proposed. The provided experiments compare the proposed approach with known strategies on various datasets and show improved results in almost all situations.},

  abstract = {Spectral unmixing aims to determine the component materials and their associated abundances from mixed pixels in a hyperspectral image. Instead of performing unmixing independently on each pixel, investigating spatial and spectral correlations among pixels can be beneficial to enhance the unmixing performance. However linking pixels across an entire image for such a purpose can be computationally cumbersome and physically unreasonable. In order to address this issue, we propose to construct superpixels for hyperspectral data unmixing. Using an SLIC-based (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) superpixel constructing process, adjacent pixels are clustered into several blocks with similar spectral signatures. After this preprocessing, unmixing is then performed with a graph-based total variation regularization to benefit from the heterogeneity within each superpixel. Experimental results on synthetic data and real hyperspectral data illustrate advantages of the proposed scheme.},

However, not only does the channel become very sensitive to manufacturing tolerances at very high symbol rates, the latency in the feedback loop becomes prohibitively large as well. Whereas the former issue has been addressed by adopting a stochastic MIMO approach where (part of) the equalization filters depend on the channel statistics rather than on the actual channel, we tackle in this paper the latency issue by setting to zero the first N taps of the feedback filters. Moreover, we show that precoded partial response (PR) signaling can improve the performance of the resulting scheme, although the achieved gain is smaller than in the case of single-input single-output (SISO) equalization.},

  abstract = {Fingerprint extraction plays an important role in criminal investigation and information security. Conventionally, latent fingerprints are not readily visible and imaging often requires to use intrusive manners. Hyperspectral imaging techniques provide a possibility to extract fingerprints in a non-intrusive manner, however it requires well-designed image analysis algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of fingerprint extraction from hyperspectral images and propose a processing scheme. The proposed scheme extracts image textures by local total variation (LTV) and uses Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) information to fuse these channels. Experiment results with a real image show the ability of the proposed method for extracting fingerprints from complex backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Many techniques have been presented to protect image content confidentiality. The owner of an image encrypts it using a key and transmits the encrypted image across a network. If the recipient is authorized to access the original content of the image, he can reconstruct it losslessly. However, if during the transmission the encrypted image is noised, some parts of the image can not be deciphered. In order to localize and correct these errors, we propose an approach based on the local Shannon entropy measurement. We first analyze this measure as a function of the block-size. We provide then a full description of our blind error localization and removal process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, based on local entropy, can be used in practice to correct noisy encrypted images, even with blocks of very small size.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we use a Siamese Neural Network based hashing method for generating binary codes with certain properties. The training architecture takes a pair of images as input. The loss function trains the network so that similar images are mapped to similar binary codes and dissimilar images to different binary codes. We add additional constraints in form of loss functions that enforce certain properties on the binary codes. The main motivation of incorporating the first constraint is maximization of entropy by generating binary codes with the same number of 1s and Os. The second constraint minimizes the mutual information between binary codes by generating orthogonal binary codes for dissimilar images. For this, we introduce orthogonality criterion for binary codes consisting of the binary values 0 and 1. Furthermore, we evaluate the properties such as mutual information and entropy of the binary codes generated with the additional constraints. We also analyze the influence of different bit sizes on those properties. The retrieval performance is evaluated by measuring Mean Average Precision (MAP) values and the results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {Over more than the last decade, there has been a significant effort in research to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This effort has been mainly driven by the need for enhancing the efficiency of power amplifiers. In this paper, we formulate the PAPR reduction problem as a feasibility problem in a real Hilbert space, and provide algorithmic solutions based on extrapolated projection methods with suitably constructed constraint sets. This set-theoretic approach provides a high flexibility and includes various existing PAPR reduction techniques as special cases. In particular, it allows for balancing between the spectral efficiency and signal distortion on a symbol-to-symbol basis, while supporting arbitrary combinations of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Moreover, we extend the proposed approach to reuse the phase of pilot subcarriers that are simultaneously used for channel estimation. Simulations show remarkable performance gains resulting from extrapolation, which makes it possible to achieve a considerable PAPR reduction in just a few iterations with low computational cost.},

In this study, we apply RoSuRe to prospect the structure of a data type (e.g. sensed data on vehicle through passive audio and magnetic observations). Applying RoSuRe to the observation data set, we obtain a new representation of the time series, respecting an underlying UoS model.

The classification performance on the dataset shows a considerable improvement compared to direct application of other unsupervised clustering methods.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study graph-based multi-arms bandit (MAB) problems aimed at optimizing actions on irregular and high-dimensional graphs. More formally, we consider a decision-maker that takes sequential actions over time and observes the experienced reward, defined as a function of a sparse graph signal. The goal is to optimize the action policy, which maximizes the reward experienced over time. The main challenges are represented by the system uncertainty (i.e., unknown parameters of the sparse graph signal model) and the high-dimensional search space. The uncertainty can be faced by online learning strategies that infer the system dynamics while taking the appropriate actions. However, the high-dimensionality makes online learning strategies highly inefficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel graph-based MAB algorithm, which is data-efficient also in high-dimensional systems. The key intuition is to infer the nature of the graph processes by learning in the graph-spectral domain, and exploit this knowledge while optimizing the actions. In particular, we model the graph signal with a sparse dictionary-based representation and we propose an online sequential decision strategy that learns the parameters of the graph processes while optimizing the action strategy.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen the emergence of the visual saliency-based image and video compression for low dynamic range (LDR) visual content. The high dynamic range (HDR) imaging is yet to follow such an approach for compression as the state-of-the-art visual saliency detection models are mainly concerned with LDR content. Although a few HDR saliency detection models have been proposed in the recent years, they lack the comprehensive validation. Current HDR image compression schemes do not differentiate salient and non-salient regions, which has been proved redundant in terms of the Human Visual System. In this paper, we propose a novel visual saliency guided layered compression scheme for HDR images. The proposed saliency detection model is robust and highly correlates with the ground truth saliency maps obtained from eye tracker. The results show a reduction of bit-rates up to 50% while retaining the same high visual quality in terms of HDR-Visual Difference Predictor (HDR-VDP) and the visual saliency-induced index for perceptual image quality assessment (VSI) metrics in the salient regions.},

We reformulate the classical observation model into a new mixture model, adopt a Bayesian approach and assign prior distributions to the unknown model parameters. First, the range profile of interest is marginalised from the Bayesian model to estimate the remaining model parameters (considered as nuisance parameters) using a stochastic EM algorithm. The range profile is then estimated via Monte Carlo simulation, conditioned on the previously estimated nuisance parameters. Results of simulations conducted with controlled data demonstrate the possibility to maintain satisfactory range estimation performance in high-background scenarios with less than 10 signal photons per pixel on average.},

Monitoring based on sub-Nyquist sampling requires two sub-systems: a sub-system on-site for sampling machinery sounds at a low rate and a sub-system off-site for detecting anomalies from the subsampled signal. This paper proposes a feature reconstruction method for enabling anomaly detection from the subsampled signal. The method applies a long short-term memory-(LSTM)-based network for reconstructing features. The novelty of the proposed network is that it receives the subsampled time-domain signal as input directly and reconstructs the feature vector of the original signal.

A conventional speech enhancement method for underdetermined situations is time-frequency masking, where speech is enhanced by multiplying zero or one to each time-frequency component appropriately. Extending this method, we switch multiple preconstructed beamformers at each time-frequency bin, each of which suppresses a particular interferer. This method can suppress an interferer even when both the target and an interferer are simultaneously active at a given time-frequency bin. As a switching criterion, selection of minimum value of the outputs of the all beamformers at each time-frequency bin is investigated. Additionally, another method using direction of arrival estimation is also investigated. In experiments, we confirmed that the proposed methods were superior to conventional time-frequency masking and fixed beamforming in the performance of speech enhancement.},

  abstract = {Typically, a single light field camera only captures a limited portion of the visual scene and the rendered views offer low spatial resolution since the full sensor resolution also needs to capture the light arriving to the sensor from multiple directions. However, many applications require a large field of view and higher spatial resolution, which cannot be offered by a single lenslet light field image. In this paper, a lenslet light field panorama creation solution is proposed based on the stitching of the sub-aperture images associated to several lenslet light fields. The proposed approach consists in capturing multiple light fields with a single lenslet camera, which is rotated to capture different scene angles; corresponding sub-aperture images associated with the multiple light field images are then stitched while avoiding misalignments. The created lenslet light field panorama should preserve the directional light information, thus allowing to change a posteriorithe perspective and the objects in focus on a panorama basis.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging enables the assessment of the brain function in both rest and active conditions. While traditional functional connectivity studies focus on determining distributed patterns of brain activity, the analysis of pair-wise correlations in the time series associated to brain regions allows a paradigm shift to graph theory making available a whole set of parameters for the analysis of the functional network. Then, the study of the properties of the networks as well as of their modulations can be performed in the space of the so-identified features potentially leading to the detection of condition-specific (static or dynamic) fingerprints. Following this guideline, this study is a first attempt to using graph-based measures for capturing task-specific signatures of a reach&grasp movement. The weighted clustering coefficient (CW), characteristic path length (SW) and small-worldness (SW) were considered and performance was assessed against classical measures (event-related (de)synchronization). Neurophysiological data were collected through high-density EEG and a stereophotogrammetric system was used for capturing the onset and end of the movement. Though not reaching statistical significance, these preliminary results witness the modulation of the function network due to reach&grasp and provide evidence in favour of the possibility of capturing such a modulation through graph-based properties. This would allow to shed light on the movement-induced reorganization of the network, which has a clear translational impact for the assessment of the recovery of patients after acute stroke.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel minutiae-based matching algorithm for fingerprint recognition. The method is built on an elegant and straightforward mathematical formulation: the minutiae set is represented by a train of complex pulses and the matching algorithm is based on a simple crosscorrelation. We propose two different implementations. The first one exploits the intrinsic sparsity of the signal representing the minutiae set in order to construct an efficient implementation. The other relies on the Fourier transform to build a fixed-length representation, being thus suitable to be used in many biometric crypto-systems. The proposed method exhibits performance comparable with NIST's Bozorth3, that is a standard de facto for minutiae matching, but it shows to be more robust with cropped fingerprints.},

  abstract = {Light field imaging based on microlens arrays - a.k.a. holoscopic, plenoptic, and integral imaging - has currently risen up as a feasible and prospective technology for future image and video applications. However, deploying actual light field applications will require identifying more powerful representation and coding solutions that support emerging manipulation and interaction functionalities. In this context, this paper proposes a novel scalable coding approach that supports a new type of scalability, referred to as Field of View (FOV) scalability, in which enhancement layers can correspond to regions of interest (ROI). The proposed scalable coding approach comprises a base layer compliant with the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, complemented by one or more enhancement layers that progressively allow richer versions of the same light field content in terms of content manipulation and interaction possibilities, for the whole scene or just for a given ROI. Experimental results show the advantages of the proposed scalable coding approach with ROI support to cater for users with different preferences/requirements in terms of interaction functionalities.},

  abstract = {Estimating the number of clusters in an observed data set poses a major challenge in cluster analysis. In the literature, the original Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used as a criterion for cluster enumeration. However, the original BIC is a generic approach that does not take the data structure of the clustering problem into account. Recently, a new BIC for cluster analysis has been derived from first principles by treating the cluster enumeration problem as a maximization of the posterior probability of candidate models given data. Based on the new BIC for cluster analysis, we propose a target enumeration and labeling algorithm. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised in the sense that it requires neither knowledge on the number of clusters nor training data. Experimental results based on real radar data of human gait show that the proposed method is able to correctly estimate the number of observed persons and, at the same time, provide labels to them with high accuracy. It is shown that, in terms of cluster enumeration performance, the proposed algorithm outperforms an existing cluster enumeration method.},

  abstract = {With the increasing amount of video being consumed by people daily, there is a danger of the rise in maliciously modified video content (i.e., `fake news') that could be used to damage innocent people or to impose a certain agenda, e.g., meddle in elections. In this paper, we consider audio manipulations in video of a person speaking to the camera. Such manipulation is easy to perform, for instance, one can just replace a part of audio, while it can dramatically change the message and the meaning of the video. With the goal to develop an automated system that can detect these audio-visual speaker inconsistencies, we consider several approaches proposed for lip-syncing and dubbing detection, based on convolutional and recurrent networks and compare them with systems that are based on more traditional classifiers. We evaluated these methods on publicly available databases VidTIMIT, AMI, and GRID, for which we generated sets of tampered data.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose two multi-channel extensions of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for acoustic event detection. The first method performs decision fusion on the activation matrices produced from independent single-channel sparse- NMF solutions. The second method is a novel extension of single-channel NMF, incorporating in its objective function a multi-channel reconstruction error and a multi-channel class sparsity term on the activation matrices produced. This class sparsity constraint is used to guarantee that the NMF solutions at a given time will contain only a few classes activated across all channels. This indirectly forces the channels to seek solutions on which they agree, thus increasing robustness. We evaluate the proposed methods on a multi-channel database of overlapping acoustic events and various background noises collected inside a smart office space. Both proposed methods outperform the single-channel baseline, with the second approach achieving a 15.4 % relative error reduction in terms of F-score.},

Understanding the impact of multisensory input (audio and video) on perceived quality is important for optimizing the delivery of these services. This work explores the impact of audio degradations on audio-visual quality. With this goal, we present a new dataset that contains audio-visual sequences with distortions only in the audio component (Im-AV-Exp2). The degradations in this new dataset correspond to commonly encountered streaming degradations, matching those found in the audio-only TCD-VoIP dataset. Using the Immersive Methodology, we perform a subjective experiment with the Im-AV-Exp2 dataset. We analyze the experimental data and compared the quality scores of the Im-AV-Exp2 and TCD-VoIP datasets. Results show that the video component act as a masking factor for certain classes of audio degradations (e.g. echo), showing that there is an interaction of video and audio quality that may depend on content.},

Real radar databases acquired by a DVB-T based Passive Radar (PR) system were characterized considering the Cross-Ambiguity Function output as the observation space. Goodness-of-fit tests were applied, and skewness and kurtosis values were estimated. The Gaussian model was proved to be suitable for high Doppler shifts. However, Mixture of Gammas and Gaussians distributions were proposed to model the intensity and the in-phase and quadrature components, respectively, of the region centred in the zero Doppler line. These results prove that, although the ECA filter rejects the most part of the interference components, a non-homogeneous characterization was required for Doppler shifts close to zero, where ground clutter effects concentrate. The proposed theoretical distributions will be useful for the formulation of optimum detectors based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, improving the detection performance of PR systems.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are widely used in many civil applications to get information on position, velocity and timing (PVT). However, current systems (such as global positioning system (GPS) and Galileo) do not include any feature to authenticate the received signal, therefore leaving open the possibility from an attacker to spoof the GNSS signal and induce a wrong PVT computation at the receiver. In this paper we propose a solution based on the superposition of an authentication message (signature) and artificial noise (AN) on top of the existing navigation signal. Both the authentication message and AN are unpredictable and therefore can not be arbitrarily generated by an attacker. After transmission, through an external public authenticated but asynchronous (thus not useful for PVT) channel, both the authentication message and the AN are revealed, allowing the receiver to check if they were present along the previously received navigation signal. We consider the hypothesis testing problem at the legitimate receiver to decide the authenticity of the message, and we analyze its performance under two attacks: a generation attack in which the attacker does not generate the authentication signal and a replay attack in which a legitimate (including authentication message) signal is replayed by the attacker with a suitable delay in order to induce the desired PVT at the victim. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is obtained for the hypothesis testing problem under the two attacks.},

Face morphing is a technique to blend facial images of two or more subjects such that the result resembles both subjects. Face morphing attacks pose a serious risk for any face recognition system. Without automated morphing detection, state of the art face recognition systems are extremely vulnerable to morphing attacks. Morphing detection methods published in literature often only work for a few types of morphs or on a single dataset with morphed photographs. We create face morphing databases with varying characteristics and how for a LBP/SVM based morphing detection method that performs on par with the state of the art (around 2% EER), the performance collapses with an EER as high as if it is tested across databases with different characteristics. In addition we show that simple image manipulations like adding noise or rescaling can be used to obscure morphing artifacts and deteriorate the morphing detection performance.},

Nevertheless, recent works (c.f., [1]) have shown promising results in terms of utilising gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithms, suggesting that in certain cases gradient-based optimisation is not the best approach to follow. In this paper, we empirically show that utilising evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms can improve the performance of deep neural networks in problems such as the detection of false alarms in ICU.

The imaging problem in radio interferometry is highly ill-posed and the choice of prior model of the sky is of utmost importance to guarantee a reliable reconstruction. Traditionally, one or more regularization terms (e.g. sparsity and positivity) are applied for the complete image. However, radio sky images can often contain individual source facets in a large empty background. More precisely, we propose to divide radio images into source occupancy regions (facets) and apply relevant regularizing assumptions for each facet. Leveraging a stochastic primal dual algorithm, we show the potential merits of applying facet-based regularization on the radio-interferometric images which results in both computation time and memory requirement savings.},

  abstract = {A novel random signal generator design that accommodates the specification of both the sample probability distribution as well as the signal bandwidth is presented in this paper. The generator achieves a high degree of computational efficiency through the nonlinear transformation of trajectories produced by a discrete-time dynamical system which has an ergodic map as evolution rule. The ergodic map is designed using a recently proposed solution of the inverse Frobenius-Perron problem that allows for the selection of the map's invariant distribution as well as its spectral characteristics. The nonlinear transformation is obtained via a novel piecewise polynomial fitting algorithm, which facilitates the approximation of absolutely continuous probability distributions over compact support with greater accuracy than existing techniques. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed design achieves a reduction in signal generation time of up to 22 % compared to a conventional generator, while at the same time using a smaller lookup table, maintaining a comparable level of accuracy, and offering flexibility in the selection of the signal bandwidth. It is concluded that the proposed approach is suitable for signal generation in applications where low computational complexity is a critical requirement.},

  abstract = {The DNA from several organisms is sequenced conjointly in metagenomics. This allows searching for exogenous microorganisms contained in the samples, with the goal of studying the evolution and co-evolution of host-pathogen, namely for building better diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the quantity and quality of the DNA present in the samples is very poor, pushing the responsibility of analysis improvements into the development of better computational methods. Here, we develop a new processing paradigm to infer the metagenomic composition analysis based on the relative compression of whole genome sequences. Using this method, we present the metagenomic composition analysis of a sedimentary ancient DNA sample, dated to 8,000 years before the present, from the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. The results show several viruses and bacteria expressing high levels of similarity relative to the samples, namely a circular virus similar to the Avon-Heathcote estuary virus 14 sequenced in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Compressive cameras acquire measurements of a scene using random projections instead of sampling at Nyquist rate. Several reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, taking advantage of previous knowledge about the scene. However, some inference tasks require to determine only certain information of the scene without incurring in the high computational reconstruction step. By reducing the computation load related to the reconstruction problem, this paper proposes a computationally efficient object detection approach based on correlation filters and sparse representation that operate over compressive measurements. We consider the problem of object detection in remote sensing scenes with multi-band images, where the pixels are expensive. The correlation filters are designed using explicit knowledge of the target appearance and the target shape to provide a way to recognize the objects from compressive measurements. Numerical experiments show the validity and efficiency of the proposed method in terms of peak-to-side lobe ratio using simulated data.},

This algorithm is inspired on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), with performance enhancements provided by applying Midpoint-based Empirical Decomposition (MED), and removing the sifting process in order to make it computational inexpensive while maintaining effectiveness towards removal of high frequency artefacts. Based on GSR signals recorded at the wrist we present an algorithm benchmark, with results from EIA being compared with a smoothing technique based on moving average filter - commonly used to pre-process GSR signals. The comparison is established on data from 20 subjects, collected while performing 33 different randomized activities with right hand, left hand and both hands, respectively. In average, the proposed algorithm enhances the signal quality by 51%, while the traditional moving average filter reaches 16% enhancement. Also, it performs 136 times faster than the EMD in terms of average computational time. As a show case, using the GSR signal from one subject, we inspect the impact of applying our algorithm on GSR features with psychophysiological relevance. Comparison with no preprocessing and moving average filtering shows the ability of our algorithm to retain relevant low frequency information.},

  pages = {2115-2119},
  abstract = {An electrolarynx (EL) is a widely used device to mechanically generate excitation signals, making it possible for laryngectomees to produce EL speech without vocal fold vibrations. Although EL speech sounds relatively intelligible, is significantly less natural than normal speech owing to its mechanical excitation signals. To address this issue, a statistical voice conversion (VC) technique based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) has been applied to EL speech enhancement. In this technique, input EL speech is converted into target normal speech by converting spectral features of the EL speech into spectral and excitation parameters of normal speech using GMMs. Although this technique makes it possible to significantly improve the naturalness of EL speech, the enhanced EL speech is still far from the target normal speech. To improve the performance of statistical EL speech enhancement, in this paper, we propose an EL-to-speech conversion method based on CLDNNs consisting of convolutional layers, long short-term memory recurrent layers, and fully connected deep neural network layers. Three CLDNNs are trained, one to convert EL speech spectral features into spectral and band-aperiodicity parameters, one to convert them into unvoiced/voiced symbols, and one to convert them into continuous F0 patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional method in terms of both objective evaluation metrics and subjective evaluation scores.},

This phenomenon is essentially due to a systematic noise component of an imaging sensor, known as photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) noise. An imaging sensor inadvertently introduces this noise pattern to all media captured by that imaging sensor. The procedure for extracting PRNU noise has been well studied in the context of photographic images, however, its extension to video has so far been neglected. In this work, considering H.264 coding standard, we describe a procedure to extract sensor fingerprint from non-stabilized videos. The crux of our method is to remove a filtering procedure applied at the decoder to reduce blockiness and to use macroblocks selectively when estimating PRNU noise pattern. Results show that our method has a potential to improve matching performance significantly.},

Ensemble learning aims to create such a high-performance meta-learner, by combining the outputs from multiple algorithms. The present work introduces a simple blind scheme for learning from ensembles of classifiers. Blind refers to the combiner who has no knowledge of the ground-truth labels that each classifier has been trained on. While most current works presume that all classifiers are independent, this work introduces a scheme that can handle dependencies between classifiers.

Currently, due to the success of deep learning in many multimedia processing tasks, there is high interest towards CNN-based detectors, and early results are already very promising. Recent studies in computer vision, however, have shown CNNs to be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, small perturbations of the input data which drive the network towards erroneous classification.

  abstract = {Bearing faults are by far the biggest single source of motor failures. Both fast Fourier (frequency based) and wavelet (time-scale based) transforms are used commonly in analyzing raw vibration or current data to detect bearing faults. A hybrid method, Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), is used in this study to provide better accuracy in detecting faults from bearing vibration data. In the proposed method, the raw vibration data is processed by fast Fourier transform. Then, the Fourier spectrum of the vibration signal is divided into segments adaptively with each segment containing part of the frequency band. Next, the wavelet transform is applied to all segments. Finally, inverse Fourier transform is utilized to obtain time domain signal with the frequency band of interest from EWT coefficients to detect bearing faults. The bearing fault related segments are identified by comparing rms values of healthy bearing vibration signal segments with the same segments of faulty bearing.

  abstract = {Wind energy experiences a significant growth during the last decades but the industry is still challenged by premature turbine component failures, which are quite expensive due to the increase of turbines size. The core of wind turbine drivetrains is a planetary gearbox and its rolling element bearings are often responsible for machinery breakdowns. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to the gear excitation and are hardly detected. As a result there is a special need for advanced signal processing tools which can detect accurately bearing faults. Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSC) appears to be a strong diagnostic tool but its interpretation is complicated for a non-expert. In this paper a novel CSC based methodology is proposed in order to extract an Improved Envelope Spectrum exploiting a specific domain of the CSC map optimally selected by a proposed criterion. The methodology is tested and validated on a wind turbine gearbox benchmarking dataset provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA.},

  abstract = {Scene classification based on acoustic information is a challenging task due to various factors such as the nonstationary nature of the environment and multiple overlapping acoustic events. In this paper, we address the acoustic scene classification problem using SoundNet, a deep convolution neural network, pre-trained on raw audio signals. We propose a classification strategy by combining scores from each layer. This is based on the hypothesis that layers of the deep convolutional network learn complementary information and combining this layer-wise information provides better classification than the features extracted from an individual layer. In addition, we also propose a pooling strategy to reduce the dimensionality of features extracted from different layers of SoundNet. Our experiments on DCASE 2016 acoustic scene classification dataset reveals the effectiveness of this layer-wise ensemble approach. The proposed approach provides a relative improvement of approx. 30.85 % over the classification accuracy provided by the best individual layer of SoundNet.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the task of gender classification on picture sharing social media networks such as Instagram and Flickr. We aim to infer the gender of an user given only a small set of the images shared in its profile. We make the assumption that user's images contain a collection of visual elements that implicitly encode discriminative patterns that allow inferring its gender, in a language independent way. This information can then be used in personalisation and recommendation. Our main hypothesis is that semantic visual features are more adequate for discriminating high-level classes. The gender detection task is formalised as: given an user's profile, represented as a bag of images, we want to infer the gender of the user. Social media profiles can be noisy and contain confounding factors, therefore we classify bags of user-profile`s images to provide a more robust prediction. Experiments using a dataset from the picture sharing social network Instagram show that the use of multiple images is key to improve detection performance. Moreover, we verify that deep semantic features are more suited for gender detection than low-level image representations. The methods proposed can infer the gender with precision scores higher than 0.825, and the best performing method achieving 0.911 precision.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of blind identification of a graph filter and its sparse input signal, thus broadening the scope of classical blind deconvolution of temporal and spatial signals to irregular graph domains. While the observations are bilinear functions of the unknowns, a mild requirement on invertibility of the filter enables an efficient convex formulation, without relying on matrix lifting that can hinder applicability to large graphs. On top of scaling, it is argued that (non-cyclic) permutation ambiguities may arise with some particular graphs. Deterministic sufficient conditions under which the proposed convex relaxation can exactly recover the unknowns are stated, along with those guaranteeing identifiability under the Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs. Numerical tests with synthetic and real-world networks illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithm, as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the singing voice separation problem and propose a novel unsupervised approach based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) exploiting rank-1 constraint (CRPCA). RPCA is a recently proposed singing voice separation algorithm that can separate singing voice from the monaural recordings. Although RPCA has been successfully applied to singing voice separation task, it ignores the different characteristic values of singular value decomposition and computational complexity to minimize the nuclear norm for separating singing voice. Since rank-l constraint in the background music, as the background music has a large variation in richness than singing voice among different songs. Furthermore, rank-1 constraint can utilize a prior target rank to separate singing voice and background music from the mixture music signal. Accordingly, the proposed CRPCA method utilizes rank-1 constraint minimization of singular values in RPCA instead of minimizing the whole nuclear norm, which can not only describe the different values of singular value decomposition, but also the computation complexity is reduced. The experiment evaluation results reveal that CRPCA can achieve better separation performance than the previous methods, especially with regard to use time frequency masking on ccMixter and DSD100 datasets. In addition, the running time on CRPCA is shorter than others under the same conditions.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning models have been recently used for detecting malicious Android applications, reporting impressive performances on benchmark datasets, even when trained only on features statically extracted from the application, such as system calls and permissions. However, recent findings have highlighted the fragility of such in-vitro evaluations with benchmark datasets, showing that very few changes to the content of Android malware may suffice to evade detection. How can we thus trust that a malware detector performing well on benchmark data will continue to do so when deployed in an operating environment? To mitigate this issue, the most popular Android malware detectors use linear, explainable machine-learning models to easily identify the most influential features contributing to each decision. In this work, we generalize this approach to any black-box machine-learning model, by leveraging a gradient-based approach to identify the most influential local features. This enables using nonlinear models to potentially increase accuracy without sacrificing interpretability of decisions. Our approach also highlights the global characteristics learned by the model to discriminate between benign and malware applications. Finally, as shown by our empirical analysis on a popular Android malware detection task, it also helps identifying potential vulnerabilities of linear and nonlinear models against adversarial manipulations.},

In one scenario of light field data compression, first a set of M reference views is encoded and then each of the remaining views is predicted by warping several reference views using disparity information. The necessary disparity information in this case may be as high as M(N-1) pairwise view disparity maps, estimated and transmitted independently for each pair (reference, target). We propose an estimation model which can be used in a flexible way for any selected configuration of references and predicted views. We study the estimation of the global model from the matching information provided by a pairwise matching program. The model may be defined in several ways, by considering the vertical and horizontal matches at various views and by allowing different model parameters for the regions from a segmentation of the scene. The regions based model is shown to perform better than a single region model. The performance of the model in synthesizing the unseen color views at specified locations in the views array is presented for several configurations of the estimation and prediction sets.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {1122-1126},
  abstract = {Acausal signals are ubiquitous in science and engineering. These processes are usually indexed by space, instead of time. Similarly to Markov processes, reciprocal processes (RPs) are defined in terms of conditional independence relations, which imply a rich sparsity structure for this class of models. In particular, the smoothing problem for Gaussian RPs can be traced back to the problem of solving a linear system with a cyclic block tridiagonal matrix as coefficient matrix. In this paper we propose two factorization techniques for the solution of the smoothing problem for Gaussian hidden reciprocal models (HRMs). The first method relies on a clever split of the problem in two subsystems where the matrices to be inverted are positive definite block tridiagonal matrices. We can thus rely on the rich literature for this kind of sparse matrices to devise an iterative procedure for the solution of the problem. The second approach, applies to scalar valued stationary reciprocal processes, in which case the coefficient matrix becomes circulant tridiagonal (and symmetric), and is based on the direct factorization of the coefficient matrix into the product of a circulant lower bidiagonal matrix and a circulant upper bidiagonal matrix. The computational complexity of both algorithms scales linearly with the length of the observation interval.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an unsupervised calibration framework aimed at calibrating RGB plus Near-InfraRed (NIR) capture setups. We favour dense feature matching for the case of multimodal data and utilize the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) flow, previously developed for matching same-category image objects. We develop an optimization procedure that minimizes the global disparity field between the two multimodal images in order to adapt SIFT flow for our calibration needs. The proposed optimization substantially increases the number of inliers and yields more robust and unambiguous calibration results.},

  abstract = {In this work, a simple and efficient approach for recognizing faces from light field images, notably from Lytro IlLum camera, is proposed. The suggested method is based on light field images property of being rendered through a multiview representation. In the preliminary analysis, feature vectors extracted from different views of the same Lytro picture are proved different enough to provide complementary information beneficial for face recognition purpose. Starting from a set of multiple views for each data, face verification problem is tackled and results are compared with those achieved with classical 2D images simulated using a single view, i.e. the central one. Two experiments are described and, in both cases, the presented method shows superior performances than standard algorithms adopted by classical imaging sensors.},

  year = {2018},
  pages = {26-30},
  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of beamforming with a planar microphone array placed in front of a wall of the room, so that the microphone array plane is perpendicular to that of the wall. While this situation is very likely to occur in a real life problem, the reflections introduced by the adjacent wall can be the cause of a serious mismatch between the actual acoustic paths and the traditionally employed free-field propagation model. We present an adaptation from the free-field to the so-called reflection-aware propagation model, that exploits an in-situ estimation of the complex and frequency-dependent wall reflectivity. Results presented in a real environment demonstrate that the proposed approach may bring significant improvements to the beamforming process compared to the free-field propagation model, as well as compared to other reflection-aware models that have been recently proposed.},

  pages = {2135-2139},
  abstract = {During traditional road surveys, inspectors capture images of pavement surface using cameras that produce 2D images, which can then be automatically processed to get a road surface condition assessment. This paper proposes a novel crack detection system that uses a light field imaging sensor, notably the Lytro Illum camera, instead of a conventional 2D camera, to capture road surface light field images. Light field images capture the light rays originating from different directions, thus providing a richer representation of the observed scene. The proposed system explores the disparity information, which can be computed from the light field, to obtain information about cracks observable in the pavement images. A simple processing system is considered, to show the potential use of this type of sensors for crack detection. Encouraging experimental crack detection results are presented based on a set of road pavement light field images captured over different pavement surface textures. A performance comparison with a state-of-the-art 2D image crack detection system is included, confirming the potential of using this type of sensors.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20 years, several crack detection algorithms have been developed to implement safe and efficient automated road condition survey (ARCS) systems. Although the current state-of-the-art algorithms can achieve a high level of accuracy, their computation time makes them infeasible to implement in real-time without massive parallelization. This paper presents a fast and accurate crack detection algorithm. The algorithm consists of the following major steps: 1) Image preprocessing; 2) Preliminary crack segmentation to minimize false negatives; 3) Crack object generation and connection to remove false positives; and 4) Refinement of the crack segmentation through a minimal path search based procedure. The proposed algorithm achieves an overall score of 80 in the Crack Detection Algorithm Performance Evaluation System (CDA-PES). With a median processing time of 0.52 seconds for 0.65 megapixel images on a single CPU thread, this algorithm makes accurate, real-time processing viable. The research presented in this paper contributes towards more widespread adoption of safer and efficient automated road condition surveys.},

  pages = {907-911},
  abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive Kalman filter algorithm is proposed for simultaneous graph topology learning and graph signal recovery from noisy time series. Each time series corresponds to one node of the graph and underlying graph edges express the causality among nodes. We assume that graph signals are generated via a multivariate auto-regressive processes (MAR), generated by an innovation noise and graph weight matrices. Then we relate the state transition matrix of Kalman filter to the graph weight matrices since both of them can play the role of signal propagation and transition. Our proposed Kalman filter for MAR processes, called KF-MAR, runs three main steps; prediction, update, and learn. In prediction and update steps, we fix the previously learned graph weight matrices and follow a regular Kalman algorithm for graph signal recovery. Then in the learning step, we use the last update of graph signal estimates and keep track of topology changes. Simulation results show that our proposed graph Kalman filter outperforms the available online algorithms for graph topology inference and also it can achieve the same performance of the batch method, when the number of observations increase.},

  pages = {533-537},
  abstract = {Machine learning has already been exploited as a useful tool for detecting malicious executable files. Data retrieved from malware samples, such as header fields, instruction sequences, or even raw bytes, is leveraged to learn models that discriminate between benign and malicious software. However, it has also been shown that machine learning and deep neural networks can be fooled by evasion attacks (also known as adversarial examples), i.e., small changes to the input data that cause misclassification at test time. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of malware detection methods that use deep networks to learn from raw bytes. We propose a gradient-based attack that is capable of evading a recently-proposed deep network suited to this purpose by only changing few specific bytes at the end of each mal ware sample, while preserving its intrusive functionality. Promising results show that our adversarial malware binaries evade the targeted network with high probability, even though less than 1 % of their bytes are modified.},
