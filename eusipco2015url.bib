  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel technique for reconstructing the phase of modified spectrograms of audio signals. From the analysis of mixtures of sinusoids we obtain relationships between phases of successive time frames in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. To obtain similar relationships over frequencies, in particular within onset frames, we study an impulse model. Instantaneous frequencies and attack times are estimated locally to encompass the class of non-stationary signals such as vibratos. These techniques ensure both the vertical coherence of partials (over frequencies) and the horizontal coherence (over time). The method is tested on a variety of data and demonstrates better performance than traditional consistency-based approaches. We also introduce an audio restoration framework and observe that our technique outperforms traditional methods.},

  abstract = {Algorithms for estimating the fundamental frequency (F0) of a signal vary in stability and accuracy. We propose a method which iteratively improves the estimates of such algorithms by applying in each step a time warp on the input signal based on the previously estimated fundamental frequency. This time warp is designed to lead to a nearly constant F0. A refine ment is then calculated through inverse time warping of the result of an F0 estimation applied to the warped signal. The proposed refinement algorithm is not limited to specific esti mators or optimized for specific input signal characteristics. The method is evaluated on synthetic audio signals as well as speech recordings and polyphonic music recordings. Results indicate a significant improvement on accuracy when using the proposed refinement in combination with several well-known F0 estimators.},

  abstract = {Music influences the affective states of its listeners. For this reason, music is extensively used in various media forms to enhance and induce emotional feeling. Automatic evaluation of affect from music can have impact on music design and can also aid further analysis of music. In this work, we present a novel scheme for affect prediction in music using a Boosted Ensemble of Single feature Filters (BESiF) model. Given a set of frame-wise features, the BESiF model predicts the affective rating as a weighted sum of filtered feature values. The BESiF model improves the Signal to Noise Ratio for arousal and valence prediction by a factor of 1.92 and 1.06, respectively, over the best baseline method. This performance is achieved using only 14 signal features for arousal (16 for valence). We further analyze the transformation of one of the features selected towards arousal prediction.},

  abstract = {Singing voice detection aims at identifying the regions in a music recording where at least one person sings. This is a challenging problem that cannot be solved without analysing the temporal evolution of the signal. Current state-of-the-art methods combine timbral with temporal characteristics, by summarising various feature values over time, e.g. by computing their variance. This leads to more contextual information, but also to increased latency, which is problematic if our goal is on-line, real-time singing voice detection. To overcome this problem and reduce the necessity to include context in the features themselves, we introduce a method that uses Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN). In experiments on several data sets, the resulting singing voice detector outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, while at the same time drastically reducing latency and increasing the time resolution of the detector.},

The method is based on a signal model that takes into account a stereophonic mixture created by mixing multiple individual channels with different pan parameters, and is hence suited for use in automatic music transcription, source separation and classification systems. Panning is done using both amplitude differences and delays. The performance of the estimator is compared to one single-channel, two multi-channel and one multi-pitch estimator using synthetic and real signals. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to correctly estimate the pitches of a mixture of three real signals when they are separated by more than 25 degrees.},

To make the scheme invariant to the DIBR process, 2D DT-DWT block coefficients of low-pass center view are used for embedding by exploiting its shift invariance and directional property.

We introduce a new model that takes into account the presence of both selfish and malicious intelligent agents that adjust their behavior to maximize their own benefits. The interactions among agents are modeled as a stochastic game with incomplete information and partially observable actions. To stimulate cooperation amongst selfish agents and thwart malicious behavior, a trust management system relying on a voting scheme is employed. Agents act as independent learners, using the Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results illustrate the severe impact of falsified information on estimation accuracy along with the noticeable improvements gained by stimulating cooperation and truth-telling, with the proposed trust management mechanism.},

This representation eliminates many of the limitations of current stereoscopic and autostereoscopic techniques. However, integral images have a large resolution and a structure based on microimages which is challenging to encode. In this paper a compression scheme for integral images based on view extraction is proposed. Average BD-rate gains of 15.7% and up to 31.3% are reported over HEVC. Parameters of the proposed coding scheme can take a large range of values. Results are first provided with an exhaustive search of the best configuration. Then an RD criterion is proposed to avoid exhaustive search methods, saving runtime while preserving the gains. Finally, additional runtime savings are reported by exploring how the different parameters interact.},

Essentially, the proposed technique distinguishes between 2D movies converted to 3D and real stereoscopic ones. It is based on the difference in sharpness around foreground objects in a converted stereo frame pair caused from the in-painting step that takes place after the generation of the right frame (rendered view) from the left frame (source view). The two variants of the algorithm, one utilizing a two-class Support Vector Machine and another one that follows a threshold based classification approach, use a sharpness metric evaluated on a stripe created around foreground objects such as human figures. Experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm, which can serve as 3D quality characterization tool, is conducted on several stereoscopic movies with very promising results.},

Complex networks represent a simplified description of the interactions present in such systems. Boolean networks were introduced as models of gene regulatory networks. Simple enough to be computationally tractable, they capture the rich dynamical behaviour of complex networks. Structure-dynamics relationships in Boolean networks have been investigated by inferring a particular structure of a network from the time sequence of its dynamical states. However, general properties of network structures, which can be obtained from their dynamics, are lacking. We create a mapping of dynamical states to structural classes, using time-delayed normalized mutual information, in an ensemble approach.

Different methods have been proposed to address moderate class imbalance issues, but there are few methods that can be successful at detecting the minority class while also keeping high accuracy, especially when applied to datasets with significant level of imbalance. In this paper, we consider SVM ensembles that are built by using a bootstrap-based undersampling technique.

During its training phase, the algorithm estimates each sensor's weight and then uses this information to assign a label to each new sample. In the experimental section, we evaluate the classiication performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real data and show its applicability to different scenarios.},

The method is designed as a part of an automatic calibration step, prior to localization of a source transmitting in the near-far field of the array. The method only requires the knowledge of the ranges between the array elements. By making the antenna elements transmit in turn, the array response model in the near-far field is ex ploited to estimate the current environment PLE. Simulation results show that this method can achieve good performance with one transmission round. The performance of the PLE estimation is investigated in the context of source localization with a sensitivity analysis to the PLE estimation.},

The objective of instrumental variables is to modify the normal equations of a biased least-squares estimator to make it asymptotically unbiased. The instrumental variable (IV) matrix, used in the modified normal equations, is required to be strongly correlated with the data matrix and uncorrelated with the noise in the measurement vector. At small SNR, the correlation between the IV matrix and the data matrix can become weak. The concept of selective angle measurements (SAM) overcomes this problem by allowing some rows of the IV matrix and data matrix to be identical. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SAM for a previously proposed 3D angle-only IV TMA algorithm. The performance improvement of SAM is verified by simulation examples.},

The methods are useful for models with homogenous regularisers (i.e., prior sufficient statistics), including all norms, composite norms and compositions of norms with linear operators. A key contribution of this paper is to show that for these models the normalisation factor of the prior has a closed-form analytic expression. This then enables the development of Bayesian inference techniques to either estimate regularisation parameters from the observed data or, alternatively, to remove them from the model by marginalisation followed by inference with the marginalised model. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is illustrated on applications to compressive sensing using an l1-wavelet analysis prior, where they outperform a state-of-the-art SURE-based technique, both in terms of estimation accuracy and computing time.},

In the last years, primal-dual methods have shown their efficiency to solve such minimization problems, their main advantage being their ability to deal with linear operators with no need to invert them. However, when the problem size becomes increasingly large, the implementation of these algorithms can be complicated, due to memory limitation issues. A simple way to overcome this difficulty consists of splitting the original numerous variables into blocks of smaller dimension, corresponding to the available memory, and to process them separately. In this paper we propose a random block-coordinate primal-dual algorithm, converging almost surely to a solution to the considered minimization problem. Moreover, an application to large-size 3D mesh denoising is provided to show the numerical efficiency of our method.},

A simplified free-space propagation is considered with a single desired source impinging a WASNs from the far-field and contaminated by a diffuse noise. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical performance of a fixed superdirective beamformer (SDBF) in presence of SROs. The SDBF performance loss due to SROs is manifested as a distortion of the nominal beampattern and an excess noise power at the output of the beamformer.

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the cross-correlation function between two microphone signals recorded in different nodes of an ad-hoc microphone array or wireless acoustic sensor network, where the transmission of the entire microphone signal from one node to another is undesirable due to power and/or bandwidth constraints. We show that instead of directly computing the cross-correlation function, it can be estimated as the solution to a deconvolution problem. This deconvolution problem can be separated into two subproblems, each of which depends on one microphone signal and an auxiliary signal derived from the other microphone signal. Three different strategies for solving this deconvolution problem are proposed, in which the two subproblems are solved jointly (symmetric deconvolution), separately (asymmetric deconvolution) or in a consensus framework (consensus deconvolution). Simulation results illustrate the performance difference in terms of estimation accuracy, noise robustness, and transmission requirements.},

  abstract = {Recent methods for microphone position calibration work with sound sources at a priori unknown locations. This is convenient for ad hoc arrays, as it requires little additional infrastructure. We propose a flexible localization algorithm by first recognizing the problem as an instance of multidimensional unfolding (MDU) - a classical problem in Euclidean geometry and psychometrics - and then solving the MDU as a special case of Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) completion. We solve the EDM completion using a semidefinite relaxation. In contrast to existing methods, the semidefinite formulation allows us to elegantly handle missing pairwise distance information, but also to incorporate various prior information about the distances between the pairs of microphones or sources, bounds on these distances, or ordinal information such as {"}microphones 1 and 2 are more apart than microphones 1 and 15{"}. The intuition that this should improve the localization performance is justified by numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC) algorithms are used to solve the problem of acoustic feedback, but, frequently, they do not address the fundamental problem of loudspeaker and source signal correlation, leading to an estimation bias if standard adaptive filtering methods are used. Loudspeaker and source signal prefiltering via the prediction-error method (PEM) can address this problem. In addition to this, the use of a frequency-domain Kalman filter (FDKF) is an appealing tool for the estimation of the adaptive feedback canceler, given the advantages it offers over other common techniques, such as Wiener filtering. In this paper, we derive an algorithm employing a PEM-based prewhitening and a frequency-domain Kalman filter (PEM-FDKF) for AFC. We demonstrate its improved performance when compared with standard frequency-domain adaptive filter (FDAF) algorithms, in terms of reduced estimation error, achievable amplification and sound quality.},

The key step of this method is the detection and estimation of the time delays of the signals relected by the interfaces between the sedimentary strata. The Teager-Kaiser (TK) operator is known as a reliable way to extract from the recorded signal the time delays of the reflected signals. Due to its sensitivity to discontinuities and excellent time resolution, this operator is a good tool to detect and estimate the time delays. We investigate whether the TK operator associated with time-frequency approaches (spectrogram, wavelets) could be of interest to the detection of time delays and perform better than the TK operator applied directly on the relected signals. The different methods are presented and compared first on synthetic signals. The results show that the use of wavelet transform improve the quality of the time-delays estimation. The algorithm is finally applied to real signals acquired in an acoustic tank experiment and the estimated parameters are very close to the ground-truth.},

Such discomfort is caused by increased sound pressure at low frequencies when the ear canal is blocked by hearing aid itself. This phenomenon is called {"}occlusion effect{"} and is one of the critical issues for hearing aids. This report proposes an occlusion reduction system based on active noise control technique using a new acoustic transducer. The proposed system can reduce the increased sound pressure in the ear canal about 26 dB around 200 Hz. While the proposed system achieved a better performance in the reduction, some distorted sounds are frequently perceived through the system. This secondary issue of the distorted sounds can also be reduced by controlling the feedback loop gain. Finally, a prototype system with the new transducer and a distortion suppressor algorithm is developed and then evaluated.},

While several single-channel DTDs can be generalized to multiple channels, only little attention was so far paid to the evaluation of the resulting multichannel DTDs. In this paper, different DTDs are reviewed and evaluated. In particular, the influence of the number of loudspeakers is investigated as new dimension in the experimental evaluation, where up to sixteen loudspeaker channels are considered. The results show that the performance of a DTD is affected by the number of loudspeaker channels whenever the cross-correlation between the loudspeaker signals is considered by the DTD. Moreover, considering this cross-correlation turned out to be necessary for a high detection performance.},

Among these two, frequency modulation is more relevant for perception and it has been shown to be present both in normophonic and dysphonic voices and to happen in similar frequency bands for both voice types. This paper presents a characterisation of the frequency modulating signal estimated for normophonic voices in terms of both its spectral characteristics and its statistical distribution. By using the discrete Fourier transform for data non-uniformly spaced in time domain, it is shown that the modulating signal may be either low-pass or band-pass (i.e. oscillating), though the low-pass case dominates in the analysed data. As for the values of the modulating signal, their distribution is shown to fairly fit a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation that significantly depends on the average fundamental frequency.},

This paper presents the use of novel Spectral Transition Measure (STM) to locate the obstruents in the continuous speech signal. The problem of obstruent detection involves detection of phonetic boundaries associated with obstruent sounds. In this paper, we propose use of STM information derived from state-of-the-art Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature set and newly developed feature set, viz., MFCC-TMP (which uses Teager Energy Operator (TEO) to exploit implicitly Magnitude and Phase information in the MFCC framework) for obstruent detection. The key idea here is to exploit capabilities of STM to capture high dynamic transitional characteristics associated with obstruent sounds. The experimental setup is developed on entire TIMIT database. For 20 ms agreement (tolerance) duration, obstruent detection rate is found to be 97.59 % with 17.65 % false acceptance using state-of-the-art MFCC-STM and 96.42 % with 12.88 % false acceptance using MFCC-TMP-STM.

Although adaptive quantization and adaptive prediction is employed in ADPCM using a fixed scalar quantization codebook/lookup table, residual correlation of the quantizer input samples is yet observed. Exploiting source correlation, it has been shown that scalar quantization performance can be improved by a time-variant quantization interval centroid leading to an adaptive codebook in the decoder. Using an ADPCM encoder and applying this principle to the ADPCM decoder with its own adaptive quantization and prediction, the mean opinion score (MOS) of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) is shown to improve by about 0.15 points for low bit rate ADPCM in error-free transmission conditions.},

  abstract = {A low complexity single microphone Tonal Noise Reduction (TNR) technique is presented for speech enhancement. This method is particularly effective in noisy environments which contain tonal noise sources, such as vehicular horns and alarms. TNR was designed to have low complexity and low memory requirements for use with battery operated communication devices. TNR detects the probability of the presence of these tonal noises which contaminate the desired speech signals. These noises are then attenuated using the proposed system for noise suppression. This is particularly effective for noise sources with a harmonic spectral structure. The proposed TNR system is able to maintain a balance between the level of noise reduction and speech distortion. Listening tests were performed to confirm the results. TNR can be used together with a general noise reduction system as a postprocessing stage by reducing the residual noise components.},

To that end, we analyze the synchronization requirements of different of PFF from literature suggested for OQAM-OFDM and determine the required amount of guard bands with respect to the applied PFFs and subcarrier spacing configurations. The simulation results prove that the required amount of guard bands for OQAM-OFDM systems is independent on the time offset between different users. As a rule of thumb we can state, that for a minimum co-user interference isolation of 20 dB a bandwidth of one subcarrier spacings of the user with the largest subcarrier spacing has to be used as in-band guard bands.},

For example, this happens in situations where the RTF is estimated from a noise-free signal of a target source whose spectrum does not span the whole frequency range. By combining a conventional RTF estimator and a selection of the active frequencies, an incomplete measurement of the RTF is obtained. We propose to retrieve the whole RTF estimate through finding the sparsest representation of the incomplete measurement in the discrete or continuous time-domain and compare both approaches. The RTF estimates are evaluated in terms of attenuation rate that measures the target signal cancellation at the output of a blocking matrix. It is shown by experiments that the reconstructed estimate can achieve significantly better attenuation than the initial (complete) estimate.},

The RTF is usually defined with respect to a unique reference sensor. Choosing the reference sensor may be a difficult task, especially for dynamic acoustic environment and setup. In this paper we propose to use a locally normalized RTF, in short local-RTF, as an acoustic feature to characterize the source direction. Local-RTF takes a neighbor sensor as the reference channel for a given sensor. The estimated local-RTF vector can thus avoid the bad effects of a noisy unique reference and have smaller estimation error than conventional RTF estimators. We propose two estimators for the local-RTF and concatenate the values across sensors and frequencies to form a high-dimensional vector which is utilized for source localization. Experiments with real-world signals show the interest of this approach.},

A clustering-based BSS approach has the advantage that it can even deal with the underdetermined case, where the sources outnumber the microphones. Among others, clustering of a normalized observation vector (NOV) has proven effective for BSS even under reverberation. We here point out that the NOV gives information about RTFs of the dominant source, and hence call it the RTF features. Most of the previous BSS methods are limited in that they undergo significant performance degradation when the number of sources is not known precisely. This paper introduces our recently developed method for joint BSS and source counting based on permutation-free clustering of the RTF features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in experiments with reverberant mixtures of an unknown number of sources with a reverberation time of up to 440 ms.},

Since absolute impulse responses are hard to identify, relative impulse responses or, equivalently, relative transfer functions are identified instead. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for convolutivemixtures offers the possibility to determine relative impulse responses implicitly by separating the target source from interfering sources. In this paper, fundamental limitations of relative transfer function (RTF) estimation are analyzed by calculating least-squares (LS)-optimal estimates in adverse scenarios, where the influence of scatterers and reverberation on the performance must be accounted for.

  abstract = {We propose a natural way to generalize relative transfer functions (RTFs) to more than one source. We first prove that such a generalization is not possible using a single multichannel spectro-temporal observation, regardless of the number of microphones. We then introduce a new transform for multichannel multi-frame spectrograms, i.e., containing several channels and time frames in each time-frequency bin. This transform allows a natural generalization which satisfies the three key properties of RTFs, namely, they can be directly estimated from observed signals, they capture spatial properties of the sources and they do not depend on emitted signals. Through simulated experiments, we show how this new method can localize multiple simultaneously active sound sources using short spectro-temporal windows, without relying on source separation.},

  year = {2015},
  pages = {429-433},
  abstract = {The ultimate goal of the EEG-fMRI analysis in refractory focal epilepsy is the precise localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) to facilitate successful surgery. Many studies have shown that simultaneous GLM-based EEG-correlated fMRI analysis can identify fMRI voxels which covary with the timing of interictal spikes assessed on EEG. However, this type of analysis often does not reveal a single focus but an extensive epileptic network. In this paper we investigate whether parallel independent component analysis (ICA), a data-driven, symmetric integration approach can disentangle this network. We assume that ICA of EEG and ICA of fMRI will reveal different temporal and spatial aspects of this network, respectively. We hypothesize that by matching these different epilepsy-related EEG and fMRI components, we can get a deeper insight in the neural processes this extensive network represents. We tested parallel ICA on 12 refractory epilepsy patients who underwent full presurgical evaluation and showed concordant data (excluding EEG-fMRI) pointing to a single epileptic focus. Our results show that parallel ICA has an added value, as it can help the interpretation of the GLM results and pinpoint the EZ. Furthermore, it might help to understand how the various aspects of epileptic activity are reflected in EEG and fMRI.},

In the field of camera-based photoplethysmography, blind source separation (BSS) techniques have been extensively applied to cope with artifacts and noise. Despite their wide usage, there is no consensus that common BSS approaches contribute to an improved analysis of camera-based photoplethysmograms (cbPPG). This contribution compares previously proposed multispectral BSS techniques to a novel spatial BSS approach for heart rate extraction from cbPPG.

  abstract = {Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in children and causes daytime sleepiness, growth failure and developmental delay. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SDB, provides an estimate of severity, called the Apnea Hypoapnea Index (AHI). PSG is costly and resource intensive; therefore we propose using the Phone Oximeter, a pulse oximeter integrated into a phone that measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), as an at-home screening tool. In clinical practice, an AHI of 2-5 indicates mild SDB, but an AHI ≥ 5 usually prompts SDB treatment. Thus, we studied the performance of the Phone Oximeter as an SDB screening tool at varying thresholds of AHI. We analyzed the SpO2 of 146 children, recorded by the Phone Oximeter, alongside conventional PSG. Time-frequency characterization of SpO2 dynamics resulted in identification of 77% and 86% of children with an AHI ≥ 2 and AHI ≥ 5, respectively, using a multiple logistic regression model.},

Since ABP signals are only available in a minority of clinical scenarios, we sought to determine whether AR could also be performed on more widely available pho-toplethysmogram (PPG) signals. AR analysis was performed on simultaneous ABP and PPG signals before, during and after a change in cardiovascular state. A novel quality metric was used to eliminate windows of low quality AR. A high level of agreement was found between the detected periodicity of each signal. The remaining cardiovascular parameters derived using AR analysis exhibited similar trends between the two signals in response to the change in state, although there was poor agreement between their absolute values. This demonstrates the feasibility of applying AR to the PPG signal, increasing the range of patients in whom cardiovascular state can be measured using AR analysis.},

Because of rapid atmospheric perturbations, the phases of the complex Fourier samples (visibilities) cannot be directly exploited, and instead linear relationships between the phases are used (phase closures and differential phases). Consequently, specific image reconstruction methods have been devised in the last few decades. Modern polychromatic OI instruments are now paving the way to multiwavelength imaging. This paper presents the derivation of a spatio-spectral ({"}3D{"}) image reconstruction algorithm called PAINTER (Polychromatic opticAl INTErferometric Reconstruction software). The algorithm is able to solve large scale problems. It relies on an iterative process, which alternates estimation of polychromatic images and of complex visibilities. The complex visibilities are not only estimated from squared moduli and closure phases, but also from differential phases, which help to better constrain the polychromatic reconstruction. Simulations on synthetic data illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

While numerous greedy techniques have been introduced for low-complexity sparse approximations, there are few non-negative versions. Among such a large class of greedy techniques, one successful method, which is called the Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) algorithm, is based on the maximum residual energy reduction at each iteration. However, the basic implementation of the OLS is computationally slow. The OLS algorithm has a fast implementation based on the QR matrix factorisation of the dictionary. The extension of such technique to the non-negative domain is possible. In this paper, we present a fast implementation of the non-negative OLS (NNOLS). The computational complexity of the algorithm is compared with the basic implementation, where the new method is faster with two orders of magnitude. We also show that, if the basic implementation of NNOLS is not computationally feasible for moderate size problems, the proposed method is tractable. We also show that the proposed algorithm is even faster than an approximate implementation of the non-negative OLS algorithm.},

The proposed method exploits a state-space structure describing the system so that a bank of particle filters can be used to efficiently track each of the time series separately. Since each gene interacts with some of the other genes, the individual filters need to exchange information about the states (genes) that they track. The analytical derivation of the posterior distribution of the states given the observed data allows for marginalization of the matrix describing the interactions in the network and for efficient implementation of the method.

The novel algorithm provides a global estimation of the variables of interest iteratively, using all the samples weighted according to the deterministic mixture scheme. Numerical results, on a multi-modal example and a localization problem in wireless sensor networks, show the advantages of the proposed schemes.},

  pages = {504-508},
  abstract = {Detecting the presence of one or multiple signals with unknown spatial signature can be addressed by testing the structure of the observation covariance matrix. The problem can be typically formulated as a sphericity test, which checks whether the spatial covariance matrix is proportional to the identity (white noise), or as a correlation test, which checks whether this matrix has a diagonal structure. When the number of samples is higher than the number of antennas, one can address this problem by formulating the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which basically compares the arithmetic and geometric means of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance/coherence matrix. The GLRT can be trivially extended to the undersampled regime by selecting only the positive sample eigenvalues. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of these extended GLRTs by determining the asymptotic law of the associated statistics under both hypotheses. The analysis is asymptotic in both the sample size (number of snapshots) and the observation dimension (number of antennas).},

More precisely, the ANMF has originally been derived under the assumption of partially homogenous Gaussian noise, i.e. where the variance is different between the observation under test and the set of secondary data. We propose in this work to relax the Gaussian hypothesis: we analyze the ANMF built with robust estimators, namely the M-estimators and the Tyler's estimator, under the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) distributions framework. In this context, we derive two asymptotic distributions for this robust ANMF. Firstly, we combine the asymptotic properties of the robust estimators and the Gaussian-based distribution of the ANMF at finite distance. Secondly, we directly derive the asymptotic distribution of the robust ANMF.},

  abstract = {Automatic context recognition enables mobile devices to react to changes in the environment and different situations. While many different sensors can be used for context recognition, the use of acoustic cues is among the most popular and successful. Current approaches to acoustic context recognition (ACR) are too costly in terms of computation and memory requirements to support an always-listening mode. This paper describes our work to develop a reduced complexity, efficient approach to ACR involving support vector machine classifiers. The principal hypothesis is that a significant fraction of training data contains information redundant to classification. Through clustering, training data can thus be selectively decimated in order to reduce the number of support vectors needed to represent discriminative hyperplanes. This represents a significant saving in terms of computational and memory efficiency, with only modest degradations in classification accuracy.},

Four HRIRs measured at different elevations or for different ears are used to construct a quaternion impulse response. A two dimensional quaternion common factor decomposition (QCFD) algorithm is developed to represent each quaternion impulse response as the convolution of two factor impulse responses. By using the proposed QCFD algorithm, quaternion impulse responses with the same elevation will share the same elevation factor while quaternion impulses with the same azimuth will share the same azimuth factor. Experimental results show that the QCFD algorithm has better performance as compared to the traditional two-dimension common factor decomposition (CFD) algorithm.},

  abstract = {For multichannel audio reproduction systems, it is crucial to set up the speakers correctly according to the multichannel format's specification. Especially, the predefined angle of every speaker with respect to the listening position must be strictly kept to avoid spatial distortions of virtual sources, the so called phantom sources. In a normal living room environment, a specification compliant setup is usually not possible. This means, the resulting audio scene may differ heavily from the originally intended scene, i.e., the phantom sources' positions change. To mitigate these spatial distortions, we propose a re-panning method of directional signals. The method groups pairs of adjacent loudspeakers into segments, analyses the direction of arrivals (DOAs) within each segment by means of a direct-ambience decomposition and re-renders the direct components with respect to the actual reproduction setup. The re-panning method was perceptually evaluated by means of a localization listening test.},

However, it strongly relies on a robust classification of the input signal. The aim of the paper is to design a reliable speech and music discriminator (SMD) for such an application. Main attention was laid on getting a good tradeoff between accuracy, reactivity and stability of the decision while keeping the delay and complexity reasonably low. To this end, short-term and long-term features are dissociated before being conveyed to two different classifiers. The two classifier outputs are combined in a final decision using a hysteresis. Objective measures show that a more reliable switching decision is achievable. The SMD was successfully implemented in MPEG Unified Speech and Audio Coding (USAC). It allows the codec to show unprecedented audio quality.},

We evaluate the performance of envelope models with respect to their ability to reduce entropy as well as their correlation to the original signal magnitude. The experiments show that in terms of entropy, distribution quantization and linear prediction are comparable, whereas for correlation, distribution quantization is better. Furthermore the coefficients of distribution quantization are independent and thus more flexible and easier to quantize than linear predictive coefficients.},

  pages = {589-593},
  abstract = {Periodic signals are encountered in many applications. Such signals can be modelled by a weighted sum of sinusoidal components whose frequencies are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. Given a data set, the fundamental frequency can be estimated in many ways including a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. Unfortunately, the ML estimator has a very high computational complexity, and the more inaccurate, but faster correlation-based estimators are therefore often used instead. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for the evaluation of the ML cost function for complex-valued data over all frequencies on a Fourier grid and up to a maximum model order. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity to a level not far from the complexity of the popular harmonic summation method which is an approximate ML estimator.},

In order to improve their performance, we propose to enrich the observation model with soft detection information and to derive a near-optimal proposal to efficiently propagate particles in the state space. This information reflecting probabilities about the object location is more reliable than the usual binary output which can yield false or missed detections. Moreover, our proposal not only incorporates the observations as in previous works, but relies on a close approximation of the optimal importance function. The resulting PF achieves high tracking accuracy and has the advantage of coping with unpredictable and abrupt movements.},

On the other hand, two or three LDR (low dynamic range) images with different exposures are captured to render high-quality HDR images in an efficient way. Experimental results show that the proposed HDR image system is capable of generating HDR images using either two or three LDR images and comparable to some existing techniques where three LDR images are always used.},

While the segmentation step is well studied, the subsequent creation of meaningful descriptors lacks this foundation. Superpixels have similar properties like affine covariant regions (keypoints), but there are fundamental differences that led to a different set of commonly used descriptors. In this paper we work towards general insights on requirements and properties of superpixel descriptors as well as a framework for experimental comparison. More precisely, we want to answer the question: Given superpixels from different images, what can superpixel descriptors tell about the ground truth overlap of the segments in the world? We propose and discuss an evaluation methodology based on image sequences with ground truth optical flow. Further, we present results of several types of superpixel descriptors and discuss the influence of the used segmentation algorithm as well as the problem of visual ambiguity in oversegmentations.},

Our method, based on marked point processes (or object processes), allows to solve the problem in a parsimonious way. It facilitates the introduction of prior knowledge and solves memory problem which is inherent to voxel based approaches used by classical tomographic reconstruction methods. The reconstruction of a 3D particle set is obtained by minimizing an energy function which defines the marked point process. To this aim, we use a simulated annealing algorithm based on Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method. To speed up the convergence of the simulated annealing, we develop an initialization method which provides the initial distribution of 3D particles. To do that, we proceed by detecting 2D particles located in projection images. Using synthetic data, we show that IOD-PVRMPP method gives better results than MinLOS-MART method for different seeding densities.},

  abstract = {The presence of nonlinearities as well as reverberation effects severely degrades the audio quality in sound reproduction systems. In this context, many adaptive strategies have been developed to compensate for room effects. However, when nonlinear distortion becomes significant, room equalization requires the introduction of suitable solutions to tackle this problem. Linearization of loudspeakers has been deeply investigated but its combination with room equalization systems may not be so straightforward, mainly when the nonlinearities present memory. In this paper, the nonlinear system has been modeled as a Volterra filter that represents the loudspeaker tandemly connected to a linear filter that corresponds to the electroacoustic path including the enclosure and the microphone setup. Based on this structure, we introduce a nonlinear filtered-x second-order adaptive Volterra filter that uses the virtual path concept to preprocess the audio signals. Simulation results validate the performance of the new approach.},

A periodic sequence is called perfect for a nonlinear filter if it causes the basis functions to be orthogonal and the autocorrelation matrix to be diagonal. In this paper, we introduce for the same purpose the quasi-perfect periodic sequences. We define a periodic sequence as quasi-perfect for a nonlinear filter if the resulting auto-correlation matrix is highly sparse. The sequence is obtained by means of a simple combinatorial rule and is formed by samples having few discrete levels.

Robust approaches for LASSO are needed in the case of heavy-tailed errors or severe outliers. We propose a novel robust LASSO method that has a non-parametric flavor: it solves a criterion function based on ranks of the residuals with LASSO penalty. The criterion is based on pairwise differences of residuals in the least absolute deviation (LAD) loss leading to a bounded influence function. With the i\-criterion we can easily incorporate other penalties such as fused LASSO for group sparsity and smoothness. For both methods, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the solutions.

Our method is evaluated on a large acoustic scene dataset using support vector machines. We outperform the previous methods when using the SPD in conjunction with the histogram of gradients. To reach further improvement, we also consider the use of an approximation of the earth mover's distance kernel to compare histograms in a more suitable way. Using the so-called Sinkhorn kernel improves the results on most of the feature configurations. Best performances reach a 92.8% F1 score.},

By means of spectral unmixing it is possible to decompose a hyperspectral image in its spectral components, the so-called endmembers, and their respective fractional spatial distributions, so-called abundance maps. New hyperspectral missions will allow to acquire hyperspectral images in new ways, for instance, in temporal series or in multi-angular acquisitions. Working with these incoming huge databases of multi-way hyperspec-tral images will raise new challenges to the hyperspectral community.

In this paper, we consider these approaches for the hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, we focus on collaborative and sparse representation classifiers and we perform an investigation on the role of the different regularizations and constraints that can be considered with respect to the classification performance. In addition, we propose to consider the Nearest Subspace Classifier with regularization which, from the experiments, has proven to be a competitive classification technique. Experimental results have been conducted considering both spectral and spatial features of a real hyperspectral image.},

Developing new biometrics and soft biometrics are therefore of interest of many applications, among them forensics.

This paper extracts heartbeat signals, using a contact-free method by a simple webcam. The extracted signals in this case are not as precise as those that can be extracted using contact-based sensors. However, the contact-free extracted heartbeat signals are shown in this paper to have some potentials to be used as soft biometrics.

Since no speciic documentation on this exists we investigate the presence of multiple image sensors in the data sets. The images under investigation, furthermore, show a strong correlation regarding their content, therefore we make use of different PRNU enhancements approaches based on weighting the PRNU depending on the image content. The enhanced PRNU is used in conjunction with different forensic techniques to detect the presence of multiple sensors in the data sets. Finally, the results of the enhancement approaches and the results without any PRNU enhancement are compared and an assessment on whether multiple sensor instances have been used in the data sets is given.},

  abstract = {Efficient digital transmission of speech requires source coding which comes at the price of unavoidable quantization errors. Thus, even in clear channel conditions, the quality of the decoded speech signal is limited due to the quantization errors. Hybrid Digital-Analog (HDA) codes circumvent this limitation by additionally transmitting the quantization error with quasi-analog methods (discrete-time, quasi-continuous-amplitude) with neither increasing the total transmission power, nor the occupied frequency bandwidth on the radio channel. So far, the HDA concept has mainly been applied to random parameters. In this paper, the HDA concept is adapted to the transmission of wideband speech signals using PCM and ADPCM coding. By experimental verification it is shown that the HDA concept may outperform conventional purely digital transmission systems at all channel qualities while additionally eliminating the quality saturation effect.},

  pages = {789-793},
  abstract = {Conventional music coders, based on a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) suffer greatly when lowering their bit-rate and delay. In particular, tonal music signals are penalized by short analysis windows and the variable length coding of the quantized MDCT coefficients demands a significant amount of bits for coding the harmonic structure. For solving such an issue, the paper proposes a frequency-domain harmonic model aiming to amend the probability model of the variable length coding of the quantized MDCT coefficients. The new model was combined successfully with an envelope based arithmetic coding at rate lower than 10 kbps, and with a context based arithmetic coding at higher bit rates in the recent 3 GPP EVS (Enhanced Voice Services) codec standard. Objective and subjective quality tests indicate that the proposed harmonic model enhances the quality of music for low-delay audio coding.},

This paper focuses on the stereo coding aspect of this block and demonstrates that, by using specially chosen spectral configurations when deriving the parametric side-information in the encoder, perceptual artifacts can be reduced and the spatial processing in the decoder can remain real-valued.

This coding approach offers the advantage of a very short algorithmic delay, due to the windowing scheme based on rectangular windowing of the residual of the linear predictor. Although widely used, the performance and structural choices of this windowing scheme have not been extensively documented. In this paper we introduce three alternative windowing schemes, as alternatives to the one already used in CELP codecs. These windowing schemes differ in their handling of transitions between frames. Our subject evaluation shows that omitting the error feedback loop yields an increase in perceptual quality at scenarios with high quantization noise. In addition, objective measures show that while error feedback improves the accuracy slightly at high bitrates, at low bitrates it causes a degradation in quality, resulting in a lower SNR.},

To overcome the disadvantages, the proposed method separately fuses the means and details of input images. The details are fused based on sparse representation, and the results keep their sharpness. Consequently, the resultant fused images are fine with sharp edges and textures. Through simulations, we show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods objectively and perceptually.},

  abstract = {This paper presents initial progress on formulating minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) broadband beam-forming using a generalised sidelobe canceller (GSC) in the context of polynomial matrix techniques. The quiescent vector is defined as a broadband steering vector, and we propose a blocking matrix design obtained by paraunitary matrix completion. The polynomial approach decouples the spatial and temporal orders of the filters in the blocking matrix, and decouples the adaptive filter order from the construction of the blocking matrix. For off-broadside constraints the polynomial approach is simple, and more accurate and considerably less costly than a standard time domain broadband GSC.},

The improved algorithm is entitled multiple shift SBR2 (MS-SBR2) which is developed based on the original SBR2 algorithm. It can achieve faster convergence than the original SBR2 algorithm by means of transferring more off-diagonal energy onto the diagonal at each iteration. Its convergence is proved and also demonstrated by means of a numerical example.

The focusing is performed in a sequential manner, i.e., we start with a uniform measurement design from which regions of interest can be extracted that the subsequent measurements then focus on. By continuously updating these target regions, gradual movement of the sources can also be tracked over time.

The characteristic that wind noise signals are sparse in time and frequency is exploited in a way that only time-frequency regions that are determined as degraded are enhanced.

This is realized by a separation of the noisy speech signal into an autoregressive filter representing the human vocal tract and its excitation signal. The clean filter coefficients of the former are estimated using a pre-trained codebook. A pitch cycle taken from clean speech is adapted to reconstruct the excitation of noisy speech segments.},

The dictionaries providing the best approximation of the noisy mixtures are used to estimate the speech component. We further employ a coupled dictionary approach that performs the approximation in the lower dimensional mel domain to benefit from the reduced computational load and better generalization, and the enhancement in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain for higher spectral resolution.

  abstract = {Dynamical systems describing a physical process with a dominant diffusion phenomenon require a large dimensional model due to their long memory. Without prior knowledge, it is however not straightforward to know if/whether one deals with a fractional order system or long memory effects. Since the parametric modeling of a fractional system is very involved, we tackle the question whether fractional insight can be gathered in a non-parametric way. In this paper we show that the classical Fourier basis leading to the Frequency Response Function (FRF) lacks fractional insight. Therefore, we introduce a TaylorFourier basis to obtain non-parametric insight in the fractional system. This analysis proposes a novel type of spectrum to visualize the spectral content of a fractional system: the Taylor-Fourier spectrum.},

Such a kernel, viewed as a tensor, admits a CPD with banded circulant factors which comprise the model parameters. To estimate them, we formulate specialized estimators based on recently proposed algorithms for the computation of structured CPDs. Then, considering the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) associated with this estimation problem. Finally, we assess the statistical performance of the proposed estimators via Monte Carlo simulations, by comparing their mean-square error with the CRB.},

Although the method is effective for modeling the dynamic behavior of features and produces signiicantly lower clas-siication error, it violates the assumption of conditional independence of the observations. The traditional approach is to ignore the problem (simply apply the mathematical approach that assumes independence). In this paper, we take an alternative approach in which we still use the same mathematical approach as before, but calculate a correction factor by integrating out the redundant dimensions. This makes it possible to compare and combine a DAF PDF and a non-DAF PDF. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.},

The results demonstrate that marginalization not only improves the overall performance, but also increases the rate of improvement for each iteration of the MHIPS algorithm. It thus reduces the required number of iterations to beat the performance of a Forward-Filter Backward Simulator approach for the same model.},

Local symmetry intervals are thus located. The sequence segmentation is further processed by applying an iterative growth on the candidate segments to remove any overlapping portions.

In this paper, our purpose is to extract different model subsets from a set of two or more AR models. The approach operates with the following steps: firstly the matrix composed of dissimilarity measures between AR-model pairs are created. This can be based on the symmetric Itakura divergence, the symmetric Itakura-Saito divergence, the log-spectral distance or Jeffrey's divergence (JD), which corresponds to the symmetric version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These matrices are then transformed to get the same properties as correlation matrices. Eigenvalue decompositions are performed to get the number of AR-model subsets and the estimations of their cardinals. Finally, K-means are used for classification. A comparative study points out the relevance of the JD-based method. Illustrations with sea radar clutter are also provided.},

  abstract = {Texture analysis is central in many image processing problems. It can be conducted by studying the local regularity fluctuations of image amplitudes, and multifractal analysis provides a theoretical and practical framework for such a characterization. Yet, due to the non Gaussian nature and intricate dependence structure of multifractal models, accurate parameter estimation is challenging: standard estimators yield modest performance, and alternative (semi-)parametric estimators exhibit prohibitive computational cost for large images. This present contribution addresses these difficulties and proposes a Bayesian procedure for the estimation of the multifractality parameter c2 for images. It relies on a recently proposed semi-parametric model for the multivariate statistics of log-wavelet leaders and on a Whittle approximation that enables its numerical evaluation. The key result is a closed-form expression for the Whittle likelihood. Numerical simulations indicate the excellent performance of the method, significantly improving estimation performance over standard estimators and computational efficiency over previously proposed Bayesian estimators.},

  year = {2015},
  pages = {1008-1012},
  abstract = {A new multifractal formalism based on the crossing-tree for H-sssi processes was recently introduced [1, 2]. The crossing-tree performs an ad-hoc decomposition of a signal based on its fluctuations, and thus represents a natural tool for the multifractal analysis of time series. The estimation of the Hausdorff spectrum happens in the context of a multifractal formalism, where the spectrum is obtained from a transform of a partition function. In this contribution, we introduce a new crossing-tree partition function, which differs from the original one presented in [2]. We show numerically that the new partition function improves the stability of the estimation in many cases, compared with the original crossing-tree partition function. Estimation is further compared with state-of-the-art techniques, including wavelet and wavelet leaders.},

  abstract = {Multifractal time series, characterized by a scale invariance and large fluctuations at all scales, are found in many fields of natural and applied sciences. Here we consider a quite general type of multifractal time series, called multifractal random walk, as non stationary stochastic processes with intermittent stationary increments. We first quickly recall how such time series can be analyzed and characterized, using structure functions and arbitrary order Hilbert spectral analysis, and then we discuss the simulation approach. Here we review recent works on this topic. We provide an unification of the works published, and discuss how to choose parameters in stochastic simulations in order to simulate a multifractal series with desired properties. In the lognormal framework we provide a new h-μ plane expressing the scale invariant properties of these simulations.},

  abstract = {We propose to use multiscale fractal dimension (FD)-based features for phoneme classification task at frame-level. During speech production, turbulence is created and hence vortices (generated due to presence of separated airflow) may travel along the vocal tract and excite vocal tract resonators. This turbulence and in effect, the embedded features of different phoneme classes, can be captured by invariant property of multiscale FD. To capture complementary information, feature-level fusion of proposed feature with state-of-the-art Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is attempted and found to be effective. In particular, single-hidden layer neural nets were trained to compute the frame classification rate. Proposed feature was able to reduce the error rate by over 1.6 % from MFCC features on TIMIT database. This is supported by significant reduction in % EER (i.e., 0.327 % to 4.795 %)1.},

While the quality of each channel is assumed to be stochastic, the availability is non-stochastic (adversarial). Moreover, cellular channels are idle only for some finite time. As acquiring prior information about channel quality and/or availability yields excessive cost, we assume that D2D devices do not possess any prior information about channels. Device pairs face the problem of selecting a suitable channel so that a successful data delivery under the energy constraint is guaranteed. We model this problem as a multi-armed bandit game with mortal arms, and provide an algorithmic solution.},

The key feature of the proposed technique is that each transmitter acquires global CSI purely through the available feedback channel (i.e., a feedback of the received signal power). In the first step of the proposed technique, each transmitter uses several observations provided by the feedback channel to learn the channel gains perceived by its intended receiver. Secondly, this information is quantized, modulated, and transmitted to the other transmitters through the power levels used by the transmitters; the latter are indirectly observed through the received signal power. Hence, the interference is used as an implicit communication channel through which local CSI is exchanged. Once global CSI is acquired, it can be used to optimize any utility function which depends on it.},

The acquisition of CSI-T is done through feedback from the receivers, which entitles a loss in degrees of freedom, due to training and feedback. This loss increases with the amount of CSI-T. In this work, after formulating an overhead model for CSI acquisition at the transmitters, we propose a distributed mechanism to find for each transmitter a subset of the complete CSI, which is used to perform interference management. The mechanism is based on many-to-many stable matching. We prove the existence of a stable matching and exploit an algorithm to reach it. Simulation results show performance improvement compared to full and minimal CSI-T.},

The classical fictitious play (FP) algorithm is impractical in large games due to demanding communication requirements and high computational complexity. A variant of FP is presented that aims to mitigate both issues. Complexity is mitigated by use of a computationally efficient Monte-Carlo based best response rule. Demanding communication problems are mitigated by implementing the algorithm in a network-based distributed setting, in which player-to-player communication is restricted to local subsets of neighboring players as determined by a (possibly sparse, but connected) preassigned communication graph.

In this paper, the head shadowing effect is taken into account for CDR estimation by using a simplified model for the frequency-dependent interaural time difference and a model for the binaural coherence of the diffuse noise field.

Audio coders are limited in the reconstruction of the high-frequency spectrum mainly because of the potential unpredictability of the structure of the latter, as well as unprecise indicators of tonal to noise ratio. We propose a technique for high-frequency tones restoration, based on the correction of the tonal positions in the decoded signal, using a small set of information transmitted through an auxiliary channel at a very low bit-rate (typically <; 2 kbps). The proposed approach is evaluated using objective measures of perceptual roughness. The experimental results with HE-AAC coding at 16 kbps exhibits an efficient preservation of the harmonicity and a significant improvement of the audio quality.},

Designed to deal with memoryless impairments, the model adopted for the nonlinear distortion is a curve composed of an invertible sequence of linear segments, capable of following the typical shape of compressed audio, and whose parameters are easily interpretable and thus constrainable. The solution builds on the posterior statistical distribution of the curve parameters given the degraded signal, and yields perceptually impressive results for real signals distorted by arbitrary curves.},

However, this approach has some drawbacks and limitations, especially with respect to the modeling of individual circuit elements. Therefore, in this paper, we present an alternative that is more flexible than the nodal DK method and hopefully allows for easier integration of almost arbitrary element models. This flexibility and generality in our opinion outweighs the relatively small cost associated with it in terms of increased matrix sizes.

Unlike conventional dereverberation methods which optimizes the dereverberation filter by noisy microphone input signals, the proposed method optimizes the dereverberation filter by noiseless microphone input signals so as to achieve a good dereverberation filter under noisy environments. Noiseless microphone input signals are estimated by multichannel Wiener filtering which can be interpreted as combination of multichannel beamforming and time-varying singlechannel Wiener filtering. In multichannel Wiener filtering, residual reverberation which cannot be reduced by the time-invariant dereverberation filter is also reduced. Optimization of the parameters are updated by using the expectation-maximization algorithm in an online manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce reverberation and background noise effectively in an online manner even when microphone input signals are observed under noisy enviornments.},

  abstract = {Representing a complex acoustic scene with audio objects is desirable but challenging in object-based spatial audio production and reproduction, especially when concurrent sound signals are present in the scene. Source separation (SS) provides a potentially useful and enabling tool for audio object extraction. These extracted objects are often remixed to reconstruct a sound field in the reproduction stage. A suitable SS method is expected to produce audio objects that ultimately deliver high quality audio after remix. The performance of these SS algorithms therefore needs to be evaluated in this context. Existing metrics for SS performance evaluation, however, do not take into account the essential sound field reconstruction process. To address this problem, here we propose a new SS evaluation method which employs a remixing strategy similar to the panning law, and provides a framework to incorporate the conventional SS metrics. We have tested our proposed method on real-room recordings processed with four SS methods, including two state-of-the-art blind source separation (BSS) methods and two classic beamforming algorithms. The evaluation results based on three conventional SS metrics are analysed.},

After introducing spectral shift-ACF features, their performance in a multiple FO-extraction in the presence of different noise types is estimated for synthetic signal scenarios. Afterwards, at novel method for F0-supertrajectory extraction is proposeds and evaluated for multiple speaker detection in the presence of background noises that typically occur in audio monitoring. It turns out that due to their improved sharpness in representing harmonic components, spectral shift-ACF features outperform classical features in many cases.},

  abstract = {A source signal is estimated using an associative memory model (AMM) and used for separation matrix optimization in linear blind source separation (BSS) to yield high quality and less distorted speech. Linear-filtering-based BSS, such as independent vector analysis (IVA), has been shown to be effective in sound source separation while avoiding non-linear signal distortion. This technique, however, requires several assumptions of sound sources being independent and generated from non-Gaussian distribution. We propose a method for estimating a linear separation matrix without any assumptions about the sources by repeating the following two steps: estimating non-distorted reference signals by using an AMM and optimizing the separation matrix to minimize an error between the estimated signal and reference signal. Experimental comparisons carried out in simultaneous speech separation suggest that the proposed method can reduce the residual distortion caused by IVA.},

First, in the tracking step the collected characteristic gait parameters support as biometric descriptors the re-identification of people, who temporarily leave the field of interest, and re-appear later.

The proposed method is adequate for implementation in networks with a large number of nodes, for which straightforward implementations would be prohibitive in terms of cost and memory.},

  pages = {1182-1186},
  abstract = {In this paper we use ultra-wideband (UWB) signals for the localization of blade tips on wind turbines. Our approach is to acquire two separate distances to each tip via time-delay estimation, and each tip is then localized by triangulation. We derive an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) delay estimator exploiting i) contextual prior information and ii) a direct-path approximation. The resulting deflection estimation algorithm is computationally feasible for online usage. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the overall triangulation uncertainty and it is observed that negative correlation between the two distance estimates is detrimental for the tip localization accuracy. Measurement data acquired in an anechoic chamber is used to confirm that the UWB-hardware complies with the desired/relevant ranging accuracy. Finally, measurement data obtained from a static test bench is used to demonstrate that the approximate MAP-based localization algorithm is able to outperform standard methods.},

The conventional method has the problem that the estimation performance is degraded in the case that positive elements change in the middle of tests because the results of the tests before a change-point are inconsistent with those of the tests after the change-point. To solve the problem, the proposed method detects the latest change-point of positive elements, and it finds positive elements by using only the results of the tests after the change-point. To detect the change-point, the proposed method makes use of the fact that the distribution of the results depends on the number of positive elements. Experimental simulation indicates that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method on the condition that positive elements change in the middle of tests.},

Detection of moving targets with wideband radar faces range migration phenomenon which is used to resolve velocity ambiguities in low pulse repetition frequency mode. The resolution is equivalent to a bi-dimensional spectrum estimation problem with non-uniform sampling, while the ability to resolve velocity ambiguity depends on spectral resolution of the method used. Recently Iterative Adaptive Approach (IAA) was shown an attractive solution of this problem. Nevertheless straightforward implementation of IAA for wideband signal suffers from high computational requirements. In this paper fast implementation of IAA for wideband data is proposed and studied with numerical simulations.

Unlike the traditional approaches, we suggest transmitting a non-linearily ampliied signal without any il-tering and addressing the OFDM sample estimation from the distorted signal at the receiver. The proposed post-distortion and detection technique is based on a Volterra model for the PA and the channel. As the transmission can switch from one sub-band to another, the CR-PA behavior varies over time and the Volterra kernels can be constant or suddenly change. Therefore, an interactive multiple model (IMM) combining extended Kalman filters is considered. The transition probability matrix, which plays a key role in the IMM, is also sequentially estimated. The resulting uplink system has various advantages: it learns from the observations and a part of the computational load is exported to the receiver, which is not battery driven unlike the mobile terminal.},

Then, each SU feeds back its maximum signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and the corresponding beam index to the CBS. The CBS selects the users having the largest SINRs for transmission. The aim of our work is to study the effect of SINR feedback quantization on the throughput of the secondary system.

However, little attention has been paid to the dual but competing task of subband selection of any desired bandwidth in D2D mode (i.e., opportunistic vacant spectrum access) and RFEH mode as well as need to minimize the subband switching cost (SSC) for an efficient implementation. Taking these factors into account, a new D2D-RFEH policy is proposed.

It is in these communities appreciated since it scales much better with state dimension n than the standard Kalman filter (KF). In short, the EnKF propagates ensembles with N state realizations instead of mean values and covariance matrices and thereby avoids the computational and storage burden of working on n × n matrices. Perhaps surprising, very little attention has been devoted to the EnKF in the signal processing community. In an attempt to change this, we present the EnKF in a Kalman filtering context. Furthermore, its application to nonlinear problems is compared to sigma point Kalman ilters and the particle ilter, so as to reveal new insights and improvements for high-dimensional filtering algorithms in general. A simulation example shows the EnKF performance in a space debris tracking application.},

In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, the IDEM algorithm is applied for blindly detecting the active sources and to estimate their locations. In the second stage, the location estimates are utilized for selecting the most useful node of microphones for the subsequent separation stage. Separation is finally obtained by utilizing the hidden variables of the IDEM algorithm to construct masks for each source in the relevant node.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for overdetermined blind source separation (BSS), which enables us to achieve good separation performance even for signals recorded in a reverberant environment. The proposed algorithm utilizes ex tra observations (channels) in overdetermined BSS to esti mate both direct and reverberant components of each source. This approach can relax the rank-1 spatial constraint, which corresponds to the assumption of a linear time-invariant mixing system. To confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we apply the relaxation of the rank-1 spatial constraint to con ventional BSS techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can avoid the degradation of separation performance for reverberant signals in some cases.},

  pages = {1266-1270},
  abstract = {Modern hearing aids often contain multiple microphones to enable the use of spatial filtering techniques for signal enhancement. To steer the spatial filtering algorithm it is necessary to localize sources of interest, which can be intelligently achieved using computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). In this article, we describe a CASA system using a binaural auditory processing model that has been extended to six channels to allow reliable localization in both azimuth and elevation, thus also distinguishing between front and back. The features used to estimate the direction are one level difference and five inter-microphone time differences of arrival (TDOA). Initial experiments are presented that show the localization errors that can be expected with this set of features on a typical multichannel hearing aid in anechoic conditions with diffuse noise.},

  abstract = {Domestic environments are particularly challenging for distant speech recognition: reverberation, background noise and interfering sources, as well as the propagation of acoustic events across adjacent rooms, critically degrade the performance of standard speech processing algorithms. In this application scenario, a crucial task is the detection and localization of speech events generated by users within the various rooms. A specific challenge of multi-room environments is the inter-room interference that negatively affects speech activity detectors. In this paper, we present and compare different solutions for the multi-room speech activity detection task. The combination of a model-based room-independent speech activity detection module with a room-dependent inside/outside classification stage, based on specific features, provides satisfactory performance. The proposed methods are evaluated on a multi-room, multi-channel corpus, where spoken commands and other typical acoustic events occur in different rooms.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a directional noise suppressor with an adjustable constant beamwidth for multichannel signal enhancement. A directional gain based on inter-channel phase difference is combined with a spectral gain commonly used in noise suppressors (NS). The beamwidth can be specified as passband edges of the directional gain. In order to implement frequency-independent constant beamwidth, frequency-proportionate band-edge phase differences are determined for the passband. Stereo perception is preserved by weighting stereo input with the common directional and spectral gain. Evaluation with signals recorded by a commercial PC demonstrates that the signal-to-noise ratio improvement and the PESQ score for the enhanced signal are equally improved in two channels by 26.1 dB and 0.2 over a conventional NS. ILD difference between the input and the output is small when the target-signal dominates the input signal.},

The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two parts: percussive part with pre-defined drum templates and harmonic part with undefined entries. The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9% for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

The presence of different musical instruments, the diversity of music genres and singing techniques make the retrieval of artist-relevant information from a song difficult. Many authors tried to address this problem by using complex features or hybrid systems. In this paper, we propose new song-level timbre-related features that are built from frame-level MFCCs via so-called i-vectors. We report artist recognition results with multiple classifiers such as K-nearest neighbor, Discriminant Analysis and Naive Bayes using these new features. Our approach yields considerable improvements and outperforms existing methods. We could achieve an 84.31% accuracy using MFCC features on a 20-classes artist recognition task.},

  abstract = {Keyword spotting in speech is a very well-researched problem, but there are almost no approaches for singing. Most speech-based approaches cannot be applied easily to singing because the phoneme durations in singing vary a lot more than in speech, especially the vowel durations. To represent expected phoneme durations, several duration modeling techniques have been developed over the years in the field of ASR. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches have not been used for keyword spotting yet. In this paper, we present a new approach for keyword spotting in singing. We first extract various features (MFCC, TRAP, PLP, RASTA-PLP) and generate phoneme posteriograms from these features. We then perform keyword spotting on these posteriograms using keyword-filler HMMs and test two different duration modeling techniques on these HMMs: Explicit-duration modeling and Post-processor duration modeling. We evaluate our approach on a small singing data set without accompaniment.},

A recently successful method for finding segment boundaries employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on spectrogram excerpts. While setting a new state of the art, it often misses boundaries defined by non-local musical cues, such as segment repetitions. To account for this, we propose a refined variant of self-similarity lag matrices representing long-term relationships. We then demonstrate different ways of fusing this feature with spectrogram excerpts within a CNN, resulting in a boundary recognition performance superior to the previous state of the art. We assume that the integration of more features in a similar fashion would improve the performance even further.},

  abstract = {Condition-based predictive maintenance can significantly improve overall equipment effectiveness provided that appropriate monitoring methods are used. Online condition monitoring systems are customized to each type of machine and need to be reconfigured when conditions change, which is costly and requires expert knowledge. Basic feature extraction methods limited to signal distribution functions and spectra are commonly used, making it difficult to automatically analyze and compare machine conditions. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to automate the condition monitoring process by continuously learning a dictionary of optimized shift-invariant feature vectors using a well-known sparse approximation method. We study how the feature vectors learned from a vibration signal evolve over time when a fault develops within a ball bearing of a rotating machine. We quantify the adaptation rate of learned features and find that this quantity changes significantly in the transitions between normal and faulty states of operation of the ball bearing.},

Due to properties of the Variational Bayes algorithm, the resulting inference algorithm is very similar for many different source assumptions. This allows us to build a modular toolbox, where it is easy to code different assumptions as different modules. By using different modules, we obtain different BSS algorithms.

A common way to achieve this is by array calibration which involves measuring the response for a finite number of given source directions and employing interpolation.

The idea is to model the array response as a product of a mutual coupling matrix, an ideal array response vector (derived from the geometry of antenna array) and an angle-dependent correction vector. Since the major effects are captured by the physical model and the mutual coupling matrix, the correction vector will be a smoother function of angle as compared to direct interpolation of the measured array response.

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a new technique for dual-function radar-communications in a transmit multi-sensor array where information embedding is achieved using phase-rotational invariance. A sequence of Q bits is first mapped into a dictionary of 2Q phase rotations. Then, one pair of transmit orthogonal waveforms is used in tandem with 2Q pairs of transmit beamforming weight vectors for embedding a certain entry of the phase-rotation dictionary during each radar pulse. The same pair of waveforms is used during all pulses while the pair of transmit beamforming weight vectors changes from pulse to pulse based on which entry of the phase-rotation dictionary is embedded. During each pulse, the receiver detects the embedded phase rotation and employ it to decipher the transmitted bit sequence. The proposed information embedding technique is angle-dependant and, therefore, the communication process is inherently secure against interception from directions other than the desired communication direction. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated in terms of the bit error rate (BER).},

The aim is to minimize the total transmission power at the base station while satisfying both signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and harvested power constraints at each user. Unlike unicast and certain broadcast scenarios, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is not tight and global optimum solution cannot be found for this problem. We propose an iterative algorithm where a convex optimization problem is solved at each iteration. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is very close to the SDR lower bound and a few number of iterations are enough for the algorithm convergence.},

The current most powerful receiver is a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver, and assumes unknown, stationary, circular, and spatially colored Gaussian noise. However, this receiver is more complex than its non-GLRT counterparts, which, unfortunately, do not perform as well in most cases. As the complexity is an important issue for practical implementations and may be prohibitive for a large number of antennas, the purpose of this paper is to propose several ways of decreasing the complexity of the GLRT receiver while keeping its performance. Simplifications of the GLRT receiver and optimization of parameters, jointly with new low-complexity receivers, are introduced. The performance of the new receivers is analyzed and compared with that of the GLRT receiver, enlightening the practical interest of these receivers.},

  abstract = {Many array-processing algorithms or applications require the estimation of a target signal subspace, e.g., for source localization or for signal enhancement. In wireless sensor networks, the straightforward estimation of a network-wide signal subspace would require a centralization of all the sensor signals to compute network-wide covariance matrices. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for network-wide signal subspace estimation in which such data centralization is avoided. The algorithm relies on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), which allows to estimate a target signal subspace in spatially correlated noise. We show that the network-wide signal subspace can be found from the inversion of the matrices containing the generalized eigenvectors of a pair of reduced-dimension sensor signal covariance matrices at each node. The resulting distributed algorithm reduces the per-node communication and computational cost, while converging to the centralized solution. Numerical simulations reveal a faster convergence speed compared to a previously proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {A TI-ADC is a circuitry to achieve high sampling rates by passing the signal and its shifted versions through a number of parallel ADCs with lower sampling rates. When the time shifts between the C channels of a TI-ADC are properly tuned, the aggregate of the obtained samples is equivalent to that of a single ADC with C-times the sampling rate. However, the performance of a TI-ADC can be seriously degraded under interchannel timing mismatch. As this non-ideality cannot be avoided in practice, we need to first estimate the mismatch value, and then, compensate it. In this paper, by adopting a stochastic bandlimited signal model we study the signal recovery problem from the samples of a TI-ADC affected by timing mismatch and jitter. In particular, we derive the Bayesian model and implement the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. The latter is achieved by means of Gibbs sampling technique.},

The overall performance of passive UHF RFID systems depends heavily on the power level of the signal impinged on the tag which is a function of the multipath channel environment in which the reader and the tags are deployed. In this paper, a channel shortening equalizer with a new constraint that exploits the knowledge of the propagation channel and the nature of the CW signal is proposed to boost the power of the impinged signal on the tag. The results show that using the proposed equalizer enhances the power level significantly which results in better performance.},

A weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) or a machine translation (MT) system can be used to generate the artificial hypotheses.

Generally speaking, the amount of speech data obtained from a person with an articulation disorder is limited because their burden is large due to strain on the speech muscles. Therefore, a trained CBN tends toward overfitting for a small corpus of training data. In our previous work, the experimental results showed speech recognition using features extracted from CBNs outperformed conventional features. However, the recognition accuracy strongly depends on the initial values of the convolution kernels. To prevent overfitting in the networks, we introduce in this paper a pre-training technique using a convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM). Through word-recognition experiments, we confirmed its superiority in comparison to convolutional networks without pre-training.},

Three types of noise robust features are considered: Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) after applying an extended spectral subtraction method, and Sphinx embedded denoising features from recent sphinx versions. Although removing C0 in MFCC-based features leads to a slight decrease in speech recognition performance, it makes the speech recognition system independent on the speech signal level. With multi-condition training, the three sets of noise-robust features lead to a rather similar behavior of performance with respect to SNR and presence of non-speech data. Overall, best performance is achieved with the extended spectral subtraction approach. Also, the performance of the PNCC features appears to be dependent on the initialization of the normalization factor.},

  year = {2015},
  pages = {1426-1430},
  abstract = {In this paper, rhythm metrics are calculated and used to classify five Arabic speech emotions; namely, neutral, sad, happy, surprised, and angry. Eight speakers (four male and four female) simulated the five emotions in their speech by speaking three selected sentences two times each. A human perception test was conducted using nine listeners (male and female). The results of a neural network-based automatic emotion recognition system using rhythm metrics were similar to the human perception test results, although less accurate. Anger was the most recognized speaker emotion and happiness was the least. One of our findings is that the emotions of male speakers are easier to recognize than those of female speakers. In addition, we found that the neural networks and rhythm metrics can be used for speaker emotion recognition using speech signals, but only when the dataset size is large enough.},

Their performance is compared with Irregular Binary LDPC (IR-B-LDPC) codes using the Sum Product algorithm (SPA). The sparse parity check matrix H of both codes are constructed using progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm with a novel initialization of the apriori log likelihood ratios (LLR) of each decoder to mitigate the highly impulsive noise in PLC channels. Numerical performance results obtained via simulations show that the proposed system at bit error rate of 10-4 achieves a coding gain of more than 21 dB compared to uncoded system and more than 6 dB compared to IR-B-LDPC codes for the same block length in bits and rates, however, this is accomplished with higher decoding complexity.},

  abstract = {Inter-cell interference is a major challenge in multi-user multi-carrier cellular networks, especially for cells with overlapping coverage. Several subcarrier and power allocation algorithms have been developed to deal with this problem. However, they focus on maximizing data rates using only physical layer information, disregarding upper layer information like the queue backlogs. Assigning subcarriers to the users based only on physical layer information like the channel conditions maximizes data rates, but may lead to network instability. To tackle this problem, we propose a cross-layer subcarrier and power allocation algorithm that uses physical layer information to reduce inter-cell interference and upper layer information to stabilize the network. Furthermore, our approach achieves a larger rate region than the baseline approach by protecting users in neighboring cells.},

  abstract = {Adaptive channel equalisation is a signal processing technique to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) in a time dispersive channel. To this end, the use of least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and its variants is widespread since they minimise the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criteria by online stochastic gradient algorithms and they asymptotically tend to the optimal Weiner solution for linearly separable channels. The kernel least mean squares (KLMS) algorithm and its variants are based on the MMSE based algorithms for non-linear channels. However, as has been pointed out in the literature, the minimum bit/symbol error rate (MBER/MSER) criterion is a better choice for adapting an equaliser as compared to the traditional approaches based on MMSE criterion. In this paper, we propose a novel equaliser that is inspired from the recently proposed MSER adaptation by Gong et al. using the kernel trick for non-linear channel equalisation.},

The joint estimation of the time delay and Doppler shift by analyzing the cross-ambiguity function is state of the art, however, this method has high computational demands as it relies on a bi-variate search. It is shown that, by using previous estimation results to initialize the analysis, a similar result can already be obtained with a univariate search, as is then sufficient to search for the variation of the delay since the last measurement. Perfect tracking is obtained with proper initialization, and for the case of incorrect initialization, convergence can be guaranteed and even influenced with a tuning parameter.

First, the signal is separated into its harmonic components. Then, the two parameters of the fundamental component are jointly estimated using a least squares approach given the estimated time-varying phase of each separated component. This method is compared to the maximum likelihood and to a modified high-order ambiguity function based method. Simulations results and a real data example demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

In this paper, we aim to extend their work to weighted graphs. We show that a naive extension of their definitions leads to inconsistent results such as discontinuity of the graph spread when regarded as a function of the graph structure. To circumvent this problem, we propose another definition of graph spread that relies on an inverse similarity matrix. We also discuss the choice of the distance function that appears in this definition. Finally, we compute and plot uncertainty curves for families of weighted graphs.},

In the graph oversampling method, nodes are duplicated and edges are appended to construct oversampled graph Laplacian matrix. It can convert an arbitrary K-colorable graph into one bipartite graph which includes all edges of the original graph. Since it uses a coloring-based algorithm, performance of graph signal processing depends on the coloring results. In this paper, we present graph oversampling based on a few different graph bipartition methods which use maximum spanning tree and eigendecomposition. Furthermore, we consider the effective selection method of duplicated nodes. The performance of the oversampled graphs is compared through an experiment on graph signal denoising.},

  abstract = {Saliency models are able to provide heatmaps highlighting areas in images which attract human gaze. Most of them are designed for still images but an increasing trend goes towards an extension to videos by adding dynamic features to the models. Nevertheless, only few are specifically designed to manage the temporal aspect. We propose a new model which quantifies the rarity natively in a spatiotemporal way. Based on a sliding temporal window, static and dynamic features are summarized by a time evolving {"}surface{"} of different features statistics, that we call the {"}hyperhistogram{"}. The rarity-maps obtained for each feature are combined with the result of a superpixel algorithm to have a more object-based orientation. The proposed model, Hyperaptor stands for hyperhistogram-based rarity prediction. The model is evaluated on a dataset of 12 videos with 2 different references along 3 different metrics. It is shown to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract = {The computational models of visual attention, originally proposed as cognitive models of human attention, nowadays are being used as front-ends to numerous vision systems like automatic object recognition. These systems are generally evaluated against eye tracking data or manually segmented salient objects in images. We previously showed that this comparison can lead to different rankings depending on which of the two ground truths is used. These findings suggest that the saliency models ranking might be different for each application and the use of eye-tracking rankings to choose a model for a given application is not optimal. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new saliency evaluation framework optimized for object recognition. This paper aims to answer the question: 1) Is the application-driven saliency models rankings consistent with classical ground truth like eye-tracking? 2) If not, which saliency models one should use for the precise CBIR applications?.},

  abstract = {Classic models of visual attention dramatically fail at predicting eye positions on visual scenes involving faces. While some recent models combine faces with low-level features, none of them consider sound as an input. Yet it is crucial in conversation or meeting scenes. In this paper, we describe and refine an audiovisual saliency model for conversation scenes. This model includes a speaker diarization algorithm which automatically modulates the saliency of conversation partners' faces and bodies according to their speaking-or-not status. To merge our different features into a master saliency map, we use an efficient statistical method (Lasso) allowing a straightforward interpretation of feature relevance. To train and evaluate our model, we run an eye tracking experiment on a publicly available meeting videobase. We show that increasing the saliency of speakers' faces (but not bodies) greatly improves the predictions of our model, compared to previous ones giving an equal and constant weight to each conversation partner.},

In this paper, we quantify the influence of three different cognitive tasks on the visual exploration of various natural scene images. Eye movements made to solve the three tasks were compared to the ones recorded during a free-exploration condition. Eye movement parameters and eye fixation positions were compared during the time course of the exploration according to fixation/saccade rank. Tasks were chosen because they implied different visual processing and might be classified according to their difficulty. We found that task difficulty impacts eye-movement characteristics at the very beginning of exploration. The variability between eye fixations of observers is also impacted. Finally, eye-movement characteristics might reveal the tasks solving.},

  abstract = {Saliency prediction for Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos has been well explored in the last decade. However, limited studies are available on High Dynamic Range (HDR) Visual Attention Models (VAMs). Considering that the characteristic of HDR content in terms of dynamic range and color gamut is quite different than those of SDR content, it is essential to identify the importance of different saliency attributes of HDR videos for designing a VAM and understand how to combine these features. To this end we propose a learning-based visual saliency fusion method for HDR content (LVBS-HDR) to combine various visual saliency features. In our approach various conspicuity maps are extracted from HDR data, and then for fusing conspicuity maps, a Random Forests algorithm is used to train a model based on the collected data from an eye-tracking experiment. Performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion method against other existing fusion methods.},

However, current algorithms focus on performance optimality, oblivious to the energy constraints that battery-powered sensor nodes usually face. To extend the lifetime of the network, nodes should be able to dynamically scale down their energy consumption when decreases in performance are tolerated. In this paper we study the relationship between energy and performance in the DANSE algorithm applied to speech enhancement. We propose two strategies that introduce flexibility to adjust the energy consumption and the desired performance. To analyze the impact of these strategies we combine an energy model with simulations. Results show that the energy consumption can be substantially reduced depending on the tolerated decrease in performance. This shows significant potential for extending the network lifetime using dynamic system reconfiguration.},

One can imagine that exploiting the natural acoustic landscape of the robot's environment can prove to be a useful alternative to vision SLAM. Visual SLAM depends on matching local features between images, whereas distributed acoustic SLAM is based on matching acoustic events. Proposed DASLAM is based on distributed microphone arrays, where each microphone is connected to a separate, moving, controllable recording device, which requires compensation for their different clock shifts. We show that this controlled mobility is necessary to deal with underdetermined cases. Estimation is done using particle filtering. Results show that both tasks can be accomplished with good precision, even for the theoretically underdetermined cases. For example, we were able to achieve mapping error as low as 17.53 cm for sound sources with localization error of 18.61 cm and clock synchronization error of 42 μs for 2 robots and 2 sources.},

The first one is instruction parallelism which is applied to a dual core architecture using OpenMP directives. The second level is data parallelism in which an SIMD specific unit is exploited. In both parallelization techniques, a minimum of initial code re-manipulation is required.

  abstract = {The rapid growth in computational capacity of general purpose processors (GPPs) has allowed for an alternative to traditional implementation of digital signal processing systems. Signal processing algorithms that were once implemented in dedicated field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and embedded digital signal processors are now being increasingly implemented using softwares. This paper presents the development of a GPP based digital beamforming system using GNU Radio - an Open Source software development platform for signal processing applications to be used with software defined radio systems. The developed beamforming system is based on minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) algorithm. We study the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the beamforming system. We provide the experimental BER results to highlight the signal recovery capabilities of the beamformer. This paper also addresses the challenges of real-time implementation and analyses the computational complexity of the GPP based digital beamforming system.},

In this paper we target the efficient implementation of binaural sound virtualization, a heavy-duty audio processing application that can eventually require 16 convolutions to synthesize a virtual sound source. For this application, we describe a data reorganization that allows to exploit the 128-bit NEON intrinsics of an ARM Cortex-A15 core. As a result, our new SIMD-accelerated implementation is capable of reproducing up to 60 sound sources under realtime conditions, compared with the 40 sound sources that can be handled by the original code.},

In particular, ℓp-norm regularization has been used effectively for signal reconstruction from measurements corrupted by zero-mean additive Gaussian noise. This paper describes a p-th power total variation (TVp) regularized op timization approach for image recovery problems in photon-limited settings using iterative reweighting. The proposed method iteratively convexities a sequence of nonconvex TVp subproblems using a weighted TV approach and is solved using a modification to the FISTA method for TV-based de-noising. We explore the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments in image deblurring.},

This results in an estimator which is able to exploit the spatial regularities of a piecewise parametric varying Hurst parameter. The pointwise estimates are jointly inferred along with the parametric form of the underlying Hurst function which characterises how the Hurst parameter varies deterministically over the spatial support of the data. Unlike recent Hurst regularisation methods, the proposed approach is flexible in that arbitrary parametric forms can be considered and is extensible in as much as the associated gradient descent algorithm can accommodate a broad class of distributional assumptions without any significant modifications. The potential benefits of the approach are illustrated with simulations of various first-order polynomial forms.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to recover road networks from aerial images. This problem is extremely challenging because roads not only exhibit a highly varying appearance but also are usually occluded by nearby objects. Most importantly, roads are complex structures as they form connected networks of segments with slowly changing width and curvature. As an effective tool for their extraction, we propose to resort to a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. Our contribution consists in representing the prior on the complex structure of the roads by higher-order potentials defined over centerline cliques. Robust PN-Potts potentials are defined over such relevant cliques as well as over background cliques to integrate long-range constraints within the objective model energy. The optimal solution is derived thanks to graph-cuts tools. We demonstrate promising results and make qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the state of the art methods on the Vaihingen database.},

However, compensation for atmospheric turbulence is still partial, which leaves good scope for digital restoration techniques to recover fine details in the images. A blind image deblurring algorithm for a single long-exposure image is proposed, which is an instance of maximum-a-posteriori estimation posed as constrained non-convex optimization problem. A view of sky contains mainly two types of sources: point-like and smooth extended sources. The algorithm takes into account this fact explicitly by imposing different priors on these components, and recovers two separate maps for them. Moreover, an appropriate prior on the blur kernel is also considered. The resulting optimization problem is solved by alternating minimization. The initial experimental results on synthetically corrupted images are promising, the algorithm is able to restore the fine details in the image, and recover the point spread function.},

Spatial endmember variability is introduced by considering the normal compositional model that assumes variable endmembers for each image pixel. A prior enforcing a smooth temporal variation of both endmembers and abundances is considered. The proposed algorithm estimates the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the endmembers and the abundances associated with each image. Since the estimators are difficult to express in closed form, we propose to sample according to the posterior distribution of interest and use the generated samples to build estimators.

A detector-based approach to speech recognition has been studied by several researchers as an alternative to the traditional HMM approach. A bank of phonetic feature detectors will produce phonetic feature posteriors, which fit well with the non-negativity constraint of NdHMM.

  abstract = {Exemplar-based feature enhancement successfully exploits a wide temporal signal context. We extend this technique with hybrid input spaces that are chosen for a more effective separation of speech from background noise. This work investigates the use of two different hybrid input spaces which are formed by incorporating the full-resolution and modulation envelope spectral representations with the Mel features. A coupled output dictionary containing Mel exemplars, which are jointly extracted with the hybrid space exemplars, is used to reconstruct the enhanced Mel features for the ASR back-end. When compared to the system which uses Mel features only as input exemplars, these hybrid input spaces are found to yield improved word error rates on the AURORA-2 database especially with unseen noise cases.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates an adaptive noise dictionary design approach to achieve an effective and computationally feasible noise modeling for the noise robust exemplar matching (N-REM) framework. N-REM approximates noisy speech segments as a linear combination of multiple length exemplars in a sparse representation (SR) formulation. Compared to the previous SR techniques with a single overcomplete dictionary, N-REM uses smaller dictionaries containing considerably fewer noise exemplars. Hence, the noise exemplars have to be selected with care to accurately model the spectrotem-poral content of the actual noise conditions. For this purpose, in a previous work, we introduced a noise exemplar selection stage before performing recognition which extracts noise exemplars from a few noise-only training sequences chosen for each target noisy utterance. In this work, we explore the impact of the several design parameters on the recognition accuracy by evaluating the system performance on the CHIME-2 and AURORA-2 databases.},

  abstract = {Recovering low-rank tensors from undercomplete linear measurements is a computationally challenging problem of great practical importance. Most existing approaches circumvent the intractability of the tensor rank by considering instead the multilinear rank. Among them, the recently proposed tensor iterative hard thresholding (TIHT) algorithm is simple and has low cost per iteration, but converges quite slowly. In this work, we propose a new step size selection heuristic for accelerating its convergence, relying on a condition which (ideally) ensures monotonic decrease of its target cost function. This condition is obtained by studying TIHT from the standpoint of the majorization-minimization strategy which underlies the normalized IHT algorithm used for sparse vector recovery. Simulation results are presented for synthetic data tensor recovery and brain MRI data tensor completion, showing that the performance of TIHT is notably improved by our heuristic, with a small to moderate increase of the cost per iteration.},

Thus, only few significant coefficients of the sparse vector needed to be stored instead of entire speech signal. During synthesis, speech signal can be reconstructed (with less error) using these significant coefficients only. Furthermore, the number of significant coefficients can be chosen adaptively based on type of segment such as voiced or unvoiced.

In this work we study sparse regression under the assumption of non white Gaussian noise and explain how to run the inference using proximal gradient methods. We investigate an application in brain imaging: the problem of source localization using magneto- and electroencephalography which allow functional brain imaging with high temporal resolution.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a sparsity-based approach for target location and velocity estimation using a network of distributed dual-frequency radar units. A single dual-frequency radar can only estimate the range and radial velocity component of the moving target. The distributed configuration permits not only target localization in cross-range and downrange, but also provides Doppler velocity diversity, which enables the estimation of the horizontal and vertical target velocity components. We develop a linear signal model for the distributed radar network configuration under dual-frequency operation, and perform joint optimization for simultaneously recovering the target location and motion parameters. Supporting simulation results are provided, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In MIMO Radar schemes, sparse scenarios have been successfully exploited by compressed sensing (CS) techniques. We address the ill-conditioning inherent to the linear model of a 3D Radar imaging system, by proposing a two-step decoupling procedure which induces structure, and allows for fast matrix products to efficiently recover the target image. This is accomplished by further combining it with an Approximate Message Passing algorithm, that yields two iterative versions for range and cross-range image recovery. Simulations suggest that besides computational efficiency, decoupling the full model matrix gives us more freedom in selecting the CS regularization levels. An FDTD based experiment also shows that the algorithms are robust in real life situations where nonideal antennas and multiple scattering naturally occur.},

The system consists of a panel and its aligned area scan camera located at a fixed position. To localize a panel pixel position in an image captured from the aligned camera, a mapping function estimation scheme is proposed between the panel and the camera coordinates. The mapping function is modeled by combining both 2-D perspective transform and lens distortion and is estimated via feature-based registration. Intensity values of individual panel pixel are then measured for sampled gray-levels. To alleviate intensity interferences from neighboring pixels, we propose to use evenly spaced dot images as panel input. By using the measured intensity values of each panel pixel, gamma curves are determined to examine the characteristics of defects on the panel, if any. Experimental results show the relevance of the proposed method.},

The aggregation is performed by applying Fisher vector on the descriptors computed on the selected keyframes. We demonstrate that the scalability and the speed are tackled by a sparse video analysis approach (i.e. extracting only few keyframes) combined with shot aggregation, while the performance is discussed around the choice of the aggregation strategy. The performance is evaluated on the CC_WEB_VIDEO dataset that is designed for the near-duplicate video retrieval assessment and for which some experiments have been conducted by different authors.},

Our contribution consists in extracting robust features directly from the quantized coefficients.

  abstract = {In mixed-resolution multiview setups, a scene is captured from various viewpoints with cameras having different spatial resolutions. Compared to full-resolution systems, mixed-resolution setups allow for savings with respect to data transmission, storage, and costs. However, for applications like free viewpoint television, high-quality images are required for all available camera perspectives. Therefore, high-resolution cameras can be used to increase the image quality of a neighboring low-resolution view. Due to occlusions, some parts of the scene are invisible in the high-resolution reference views and thus cannot be directly synthesized from the neighboring perspectives. In this paper, we propose to integrate the idea of single-image super-resolution to better handle occluded areas and thus to improve the super-resolution quality for mixed-resolution multiview images. For a downsampling factor of 4, the proposed method achieves an average gain of 0.53 dB with respect to a comparable multiview super-resolution approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fast online background subtraction algorithm detecting a contiguous foreground. The proposed algorithm consists of a background model and a foreground model. The background model is a regression based low rank model. It seeks a low rank background subspace and represents the background as the linear combination of the basis spanning the subspace. The foreground model promotes the contiguity in the foreground detection. It encourages the foreground to be detected as whole regions rather than separated pixels. We formulate the background and foreground model into a contiguously weighted linear regression problem. This problem can be solved efficiently and it achieves an online scheme. The experimental comparison with most recent algorithms on the benchmark dataset demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the next generation video coding standard. The HEVC provides equivalent perceptual quality with bit-budget saving greater than 50% compared to the H.264/AVC. In this paper, we propose a new fast intra prediction mode decision algorithm for the HEVC. We apply an early termination method based on the statistics of the resulted IPMs from both rough mode decision and most probable mode stages. The resulted IPMs are clustered into a K cluster by means of the K-medoid clustering algorithm, and each IPM cluster center represents all the IPMs within a cluster for the RDO process. The sugeested algorithm has been evaluated on high resolution test video sequences. Compared with the current HM16.0 and state-of-the-art scheme in all intra high efficiency configuration cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme in terms of encoding time with similar coding efficiency.},

Both modalities are then symmetrically integrated, to achieve a high resolution in time and space while allowing some robustness against potential decoupling of the BOLD effect. The novelty of the approach consists in expressing the joint imaging problem as a linear inverse problem, which is addressed using sparse regularization. We consider several sparsity-enforcing penalties, which naturally reflect the fact that only few areas of the brain are activated at a certain time, and allow for a fast optimization through proximal algorithms.

In contrast to common methods such as independent component analysis, only mild assumptions are imposed on the sources.

As such, the blind source separation problem can be reformulated as the computation of a tensor decomposition by applying a low-rank approximation to the tensorized mixing vectors. This allows the introduction of blind source separation in certain big data applications, where other methods fall short.},

This approach also initially does not set restrictions on e.g. statistical independence, nonnegativity or sparsity, but on linear independence of sources and some source products. The separation principle used for adapting the parameters of the above structure consists in fitting the observations with the above direct model. We prove (for two sources at this stage) that this principle ensures separability, i.e. unique decomposition. Associated criteria and algorithms are also described. Performance is illustrated with preprocessed hyperspectral remote sensing data. This also allows us to highlight potential conditioning issues of some practical bilinear matrix factorization (BMF) methods and to suggest how to extend them.},

  abstract = {Magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) refers to a passive method used to reveal hidden magnetic masses and is most commonly based on a dipolar target model. This paper proposes a generalization of the MAD through a multipolar model that provides a more precise description of the anomaly and serves a twofold objective: to improve the detection performance, and to widen the variety of detectable targets. The dipole detection strategy - namely an orthonormal decomposition of the anomaly followed by a generalized likelihood ratio test - is hence revisited in the multipolar case. The performance are assessed analytically and the relevance of this generalization is demonstrated on multipolar scenarios.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to classify rainfall radar images by using the scattering transform, which gives us a translation invariant representation of the images and preserves high-frequency information useful to encode important morphological aspects of the meteorological phenomena under study. To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, a classification framework is considered, where the images are to be classified into 4 morphological classes: light rain, shower, unorganised storm and organised storm. Experiments show that the benefits of the scattering are threefold: 1) it provides complementary information with respect to more traditional features computed over the distribution of the rainfall intensities, 2) it provides strong invariance to deformations, 3) second order coefficients of the scattering transform nicely encodes spatial distribution of rain intensity.},

We introduce a method stemming from consumer theory and cooperative game theory that uses CES to balance the load of an entire locality and manage household energy allocations respectively. Load balancing is derived as a geometric programming problem. Each households contribution to overall non-uniformity of the load profile is modeled using a characteristic function and Shapley values are used to allocate the amount and price of surplus energy stored in CES.

They assume the system can switch between an a priori infinite number of state-space representations (SSR) whose parameters are on-line inferred. The estimation problem can thus be of high dimension when the SSR matrices are unknown. Nevertheless, in many applications, the SSRs can be categorized in different classes. In each class, the SSRs are characterized by a known functional form but differ by a reduced set of unknown hyperparameters. To use this information, we thus propose a new hierarchical model for the SLDM wherein a discrete variable indicates the SSR class. Conditionally to this class, the distributions of the hyperparameters are modeled by DPs. The estimation problem is solved by using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Simulation results show that our model outperforms existing methods in the field of target tracking.},

Then a four-state HMM is employed to track notes on the gains of each pitch. We increase the likelihood of staying in silence for low pitches and set a minimum duration to reduce short false-positive notes. For quickly repeated notes, we allow the note state to transition from decay directly back to attack. The experiments tested on 30 piano pieces from the MAPS dataset shows promising results for both frame-wise and note-wise transcription.},

  abstract = {Soft-clipping algorithms used to implement musical distortion effects are major sources of aliasing due to their nonlinear behavior. It is a research challenge to design computationally efficient methods for alias-free distortion without over-sampling. In the proposed approach, soft clipping is decomposed into a hard clipper and a low-order polynomial part. A technique for aliasing reduction of the hard-clipped signal is presented based on a polynomial approximation of the ban-dlimited ramp function. This correction function operates by quasi-bandlimiting the discontinuities introduced in the first derivative of the signal.

In this paper a parallel DSP architecture for the efficient implementation of the acoustic piano on embedded processors is reported. The resulting model is able to provide faithful reproduction of the acoustic piano physical behaviour and can also be used as an engine for novel instruments that need to provide advanced multimodal output (haptics, spatial audio) with a low-cost embedded platform.},

The Model-based EM Source Separation and Localization (MESSL) algorithm is one such approach for binaural signals that achieves additional robustness by enforcing consistency in inaural parameters across frequency. This paper incorporates MESSL into a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework in order to addition ally enforce consistency in the assignment of neighboring time-frequency units to sources. Approximate inference in the MRF is performed using loopy belief propagation (LBP), and the same approach can be used to smooth any probabilistic source separation mask. The proposed MESSL-MRF algorithm is tested on binaural mixtures of three sources in reverberant conditions and shows significant improvements over the original MESSL algorithm as measured by both signal-to-distortion ratios as well as a speech intelligibility predictor.},

We previously proposed a generative model of multichannel signals called the multichannel facto rial hidden Markov model, which allows us to simultaneously solve these problems through a joint optimization problem formulation. In this approach, we modeled the spatial cor relation matrix of each source as a weighted sum of the spatial correlation matrices corresponding to all possible DOAs. However, it became clear through real environment experiments that the estimate of the spatial correlation matrix tended to deviate from the actual correlation matrix since the plane wave assumption does not hold due to reverber ation and noise components. To handle such deviations, we propose introducing a prior distribution over the spatial correlation matrices called the DOA mixture model instead of using the weighted sum model. The experiment showed that the proposed method provided 1.94 [dB] improvement compared with our previous method in terms of the the signal-to-distortion ratios of separated signals.},

To evaluate the performance of speech enhancement methods for such scenarios, we consider a stereo mixture composed of a speech signal and interfering sources. We apply different approaches to separate the mixture into two components, where the first component contains mainly speech (the desired signal) and the second component contains the rest of the mixture. An improved stereo signal is constructed by recombining these components such that speech gets emphasized with respect to the rest of the mixture and at the same time the amount of artifacts is kept to a minimum. Listening tests and objective measures show that the center extraction approach is in general the most effective, although it is sensitive to speaker positioning.},

On the other side, to overcome such techniques, smart hackers can try firstly to remove keypoints before performing image patch cloning in order to inhibit the successive matching operation. However, keypoint removal determines per se some suspicious empty areas that could indicate that a manipulation has occurred. In this paper, the goal to nullify SIFT matches while preserving keypoints is pursued. The basic idea is to succeed in altering the features descriptor by means of shifting the dominant orientation associated to a specific keypoint. In fact, to provide rotation invariance, all the values of the descriptor are computed according to such orientation. So doing, it should impair the whole matching phase.},

The prediction of the unknown emotion trajectory in the affect space spanned by Arousal, Valence, and Dominance (A-V-D) descriptors is cast as a time series filtering task. The state space models we investigated include a standard linear model (Kalman filter) as well as novel non-linear, non-parametric Gaussian Processes (GP) based SSM. We use the AVEC 2014 database for evaluation, which provides ground truth A-V-D labels which allows state and measurement functions to be learned separately simplifying the model training. For the filtering with GP SSM, we used two approximation methods: a recently proposed analytic method and Particle filter. All models were evaluated in terms of average Pearson correlation R and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that using the same feature vectors, the GP SSMs achieve twice higher correlation and twice smaller RMSE than a Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {Speaker de-identification is an interesting and newly investigated task in speech processing. In the current implementations, this task is based on transforming one speaker speech to another speaker in order to hide the speaker identity. In this paper we present a discriminative approach for human speaker selection for speaker de-identification. We used two modules, a speaker identification system and a speaker transformation one, to select the most appropriate speaker to transform the source speaker speech from a set of speakers. In order to select the target speaker, we minimize the identification confidence of the transformed speech as the source speaker and maximize the confusion about the transformed speech membership to the rest of the speaker models and the identiication conidence of the re-transformed speech using the source speaker model. These three factors are combined to achieve overall optimization performance in order to select the best target speaker to transform the source.},

Different applications, such as document structuring or information retrieval have led to the exploration of speaker diarization in many different domains, from broadcast news to lectures, phone conversations and meetings. Almost all current diarization systems are offline and ill-suited to the growing need for online or real-time diarization, stemming from the increasing popularity of powerful, mobile smart devices. While a small number of such systems have been reported, truly online diarization systems for challenging and highly spontaneous meeting data are lacking. This paper reports our work to develop an adaptive and online diarization system using the NIST Rich Transcription meetings corpora. While not dissimilar to those previously reported for less challenging domains, high diarization error rates illustrate the challenge ahead and lead to some ideas to improve performance through future research.},

In the feature level, the number of impostor samples is considerably large compared to previous works based on i-vectors. Therefore, those i-vector based impostor selection algorithms are not computationally practical. On the other hand, the number of samples for each target speaker is different from one speaker to another which makes the training process more difficult. In this work, we take advantage of DBN unsupervised learning to train a global model, which will be referred to as Universal DBN (UDBN). Then we adapt this UDBN to the data of each target speaker. The evaluation is performed on the core test condition of the NIST SRE 2006 database and it is shown that the proposed architecture achieves more than 8% relative improvement in comparison to the conventional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).},

In this FDM system the spectral efficiency can be increased by reducing the spacing between two adjacent channels. The proposed receiver is designed by adopting a simplified representation of a binary CPM signal with the principal component of its Laurent decomposition and is obtained by using the framework based on factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm. This detector can be used for iterative detection/decoding of a coded scheme in which each user employs a binary CPM modulator serially concatenated with an outer encoder through a pseudo-random interleaver. It does not require an explicit estimation of the modulation index nor of the channel phase and is very robust to large uncertainties of the nominal value of the modulation index.},

  abstract = {The continuously growing demand for wireless connectivity has turned bandwidth into a scarce resource that should be carefully managed. A common solution is to assign disjoint portions of the bandwidth to different users, but the portion size decreases as the number of users grows. An alternative solution is to introduce spatial diversity through coordinated base stations, but such systems are very sensitive to timing and frequency synchronization offsets. To tackle these problems, we use principles of network coding for bandwidth management in a double relay cellular system of two base stations and two users. We propose a three-time-slot transmission strategy and a MMSE reception strategy. It avoids the need of tight frequency or timing synchronization through a simple communication protocol without using additional bandwidth or infrastructure. By finding a balance between spatial diversity and transmission time, our approach achieves the system capacity and fairness in all SNR conditions.},

Our main interest is to show whether FTN signaling can recover the loss of spectral efficiency (SE) due to guard bands by adjusting the symbol duration and tolerating ISI in practical coexistence scenarios. In this paper, the SE of FTN signaling is investigated taking into account a practical multi-access channel, where a single-carrier system based on Nyquist or FTN signaling shares spectrum with a multi-carrier system. A single-user based on OQAM/OFDM system is considered as reference system. Simulation results show that by choosing an appropriate symbol duration, FTN signaling can recover the loss of SE at high SNRs. Furthermore, in coexistence scenarios with small guard bands, using FTN the SE curve is very close to that of the single-user reference system.},

  abstract = {The analysis of vibrations from rotating machines gives information about their faults. From the signal processing perspective a significant problem is the detection of weak signals embedded in strong noise. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a mechanism where noise is not suppressed but exploited to trigger the synchronization of a non-linear system and in its one-dimensional form has been recently applied to vibration analysis. This paper focuses on the use of SR in a two-dimensional system of gradient type for detection of weak signals submerged in Gaussian noise. Comparing the traditional one-dimensional system and the two-dimensional used here, this paper shows that the latter can offer a more sensitive means of detection. An alternative metric is proposed to assess the output signal quality, requiring no a priori knowledge of the signal to be detected, and it is shown to offer similar results to the more conventional signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been much focus on mobile ad-hoc sensor networks. The mobility alleviates several issues relating to sensor network coverage and connectivity, whereas aggravates the difficulties of applications such as target tracking. Traditional solutions always localize the sensors first, and then track the target. In contrast, cooperative simultaneous localization and tracking (CoSLAT) adopts both the sensor-target and the inter-sensor observations to simultaneously refine the target and the sensor estimates. We propose a distributed variational filtering (VF) algorithm for CoSLAT, which greatly cuts down the estimate errors, while having nearly the same complexity as the traditional particle filtering (PF) algorithm. In addition, the update and the approximation of the a posteriori distribution are jointly performed by the VF, yielding a natural and adaptive compression. Since the temporal dependence is reduced from a great number of particles to one Gaussian component, the communication cost is significantly diminished.},

Here, the usefulness of Whittle estimator is illustrated by a Monte Carlo simulation and by fitting the periodic autoregressive moving average model to daily mean concentrations of particulate matter observed in Cariacica, Brazil.

  abstract = {We describe new Bayesian algorithms for cooperative blind equalization in a network in which the signal broadcast by a single transmitter is received by multiple remote nodes through distinct frequency-selective channels. The algorithms are based on Rao-Blackwellized point mass filters, and approximate the posterior densities of the unknown channel parameters by Gaussian mixtures of fixed order. To keep computations treatable, density mixtures are reduced by a modified version of West's algorithm. A reduced complexity approach which employs a single mode approximation of some remote quantities is also considered.

The paper proposes a new adaptive method consisting of probability kernel-based evaluation of importance weights with online determination of kernel scale.

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression, which is applied to both real-valued and complex-valued data sets. For complex data, a modified version of PCA based on widely linear transformations was shown to be beneficial if the considered random variables are improper, i.e., in the case of correlations or power imbalances between real and imaginary parts. This widely linear approach is formulated in an augmented complex representation in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a composite real PCA, which instead transforms the complex data into a set of real-valued principal components. This alternative approach is superior in dimensionality reduction due to the finer granularity that is possible when counting dimensions in the real-valued representation. Moreover, it can be used to obtain the same results as the augmented complex version at a lower computational complexity.},

In this paper, we show that an association field of this type can be used to enhance the sparse representation of natural images. First, we define the SparseLets framework as an efficient representation of images based on a discrete wavelet transform. Second, we extract second-order information about edge co-occurrences from a set of images of natural scenes. Finally, we incorporate this prior information into our framework and show that it allows for the extraction of features relevant to natural scenes, like a round shape. This novel approach points the way to practical computer vision algorithms with human-like performance.},

  abstract = {In chronobiology a periodic components variation analysis for the signals expressing the biological rhythms is needed. Therefore precise estimation of the periodic components is required. The classical approaches, based on FFT methods, are inefficient considering the particularities of the data (non-stationary, short length and noisy). In this paper we propose a new method using inverse problem and Bayesian approach with sparsity enforcing prior. The considered prior law is the Student-t distribution, viewed as a marginal distribution of an Infinite Gaussian Scale Mixture (IGSM) defined via the inverse variances. For modelling the non stationarity of the observed signal and the noise we use a Gaussian model with unknown variances. To infer those variances as well as the variances of the periodic components we use conjugate priors. From the joint posterior law the unknowns are estimated via Posterior Mean (PM) using the Variational Bayesian Approximation (VBA). Finally, we validate the proposed method on synthetic data and present some preliminary results for real chronobiological data.},

The discrete-time state space model is used to describe the systems. The attacks are modeled as additive signals of short duration on both state evolution and sensor measurement equations. The steady-state Kalman filter is employed to generate the sequence of innovations. Next, these independent random variables are used as entries of the Variable Threshold Window Limited CUmulative SUM (VTWL CUSUM) test.

  abstract = {Incipient fault diagnosis has become a key issue for reliability and safety of industrial processes. Data-driven methods are effective for feature extraction and feature analysis using multivariate statistical techniques. Beside fault detection, fault estimation is essential for making the appropriate decision (safe stop or fault accommodation). Therefore, in this paper, we have developed an analytical model of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for Gamma distributed data to be used for the fault severity estimation. In the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework, the proposed model of the KLD has been analysed and compared to an estimated value of the KLD using the Monte-Carlo estimator. The results show that for incipient faults (<;10%) in usual noise conditions (SNR>40dB), the analytical model is accurate enough with a relative error around 10%.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an audio watermarking method based on dynamic phase coding and error control coding. The technique of quantization index modulation is employed for embedding watermarks into the phase spectrum of audio signals. Since most of the audio information is distributed in moderately low frequencies, to increase robustness, this frequency region is chosen for embedding watermarks. Phase modification causes sound distortion in a manner that is proportional to the magnitude. Therefore, the amount of phase modification is adjusted according to the magnitude to balance inaudibility and robustness. Error control coding is incorporated to further increase reliability of watermark detection. The experimental results show that the watermarks could be kept inaudible in watermarked signals and robust against various attacks. Error control coding is effective in increasing watermark detection accuracy remarkably.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new approach for sampling rate offset (SRO) estimation between nodes of a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) is proposed using the phase drift of the coherence function between the signals. This method, referred to as least squares coherence drift (LCD) estimation, assumes that the SRO induces a linearly increasing phase-shift in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. This phase-shift, observed as a drift in the phase of the signal coherence, is applied in a least-squares estimation framework to estimate the SRO. Simulation results in different scenarios show that the LCD estimation approach can estimate the SRO with a mean absolute error of around 1%. We finally demonstrate that the use of the LCD estimation within a compensation approach eliminates the performance-loss due to SRO in a multichannel Wiener filter (MWF)-based speech enhancement task.},

  abstract = {Sounds provide substantial information on human activities in an indoor environment, such as an apartment or a house, but it is a difficult task to classify them, mainly due to the variability and the diversity of realization of sounds in those environments. In this paper, sounds are considered as a class of information, to be mixed with other modalities (video in particular) in the design of ambient monitoring systems. As a consequence, we propose a classification scheme aimed at (i) exploiting the specificities of this modality with respect to others and (ii) leaving doubtful events for further analysis, so that the risk of errors is overall minimized. A dedicated taxonomy together with belief functions are proposed in this respect. Belief functions are an adapted way to face the variability of sounds, as they are able to quantify their impossibility to classify the signals when it differs too much from what is known by creating class of doubt. The algorithm is tested on a dataset composed of real-life signals.},

The recently proposed direct-path dominance test provides a means of identifying time-frequency regions in which a single signal path is dominant. By analysing only these regions it was shown that the accuracy of the FS-MUSIC algorithm could be significantly improved. However, for real-time implementation a less computationally demanding localisation algorithm would be preferable. In the present contribution we investigate the direct-path dominance test as a preprocessing step to pseudo-intensity vector-based localisation.

In particular, we introduce a novel approach to extract the signal portions that are not distorted with multipath signals and noise. We do not make any stochastic and sparseness assumptions regarding the underlying signal source. Hence, our approach can be applied to a wide range of wideband acoustic signals. We present experiments with acoustic signals that are specially exposed to long reverberations, where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is as low as 0 dB. In these experiments, the proposed method reliably estimates the source direction with less than 5 degrees of error even under the introduced significantly high reverberation conditions.},

Auditory saliency is assessed by auditory and perceptual cues such as Teager energy, loudness and roughness; all known to correlate with attention and human hearing. Text analysis incorporates part-of-speech tagging and affective modeling. A computational method for the automatic correction of the boundaries of the selected audio events is applied creating summaries that consist not only of salient but also meaningful and semantically coherent events. A non-parametric classification technique is employed and results are reported on the MovSum movie database using objective evaluations against ground-truth designating the auditory and semantically salient events.},

We study chromatic aberration for a system that jointly records color and near-infrared (NIR) images on a single sensor. Chromatic aberration in such a system leads to a blurred NIR image when the color image is in-focus and sharp. We propose an algorithm that deblurs the NIR image using the gradients of the sharp color image, as both scene representations are generally similar. However, the details of these images often exhibit significant differences due to varying scene reflection and absorption in the corresponding bands. To account for this, we compute the correlation between color and NIR gradients, and use the gradients of the color image in reconstructing NIR only where the gradients are highly correlated. We propose a multiscale scheme that gradually deblurs NIR and accurately computes similarities between color and NIR gradients. Experimental results show that our algorithm recovers details of NIR without producing visible artifacts.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection schemes have been used to identify the unwanted noise and this helps us to obtain underlying valuable signals and predicting the next state of the systems/signals. However, there are few researches on sequential outlier detection in time series although a lot of outlier detection algorithms are developed in off-line systems. In this paper, we focus on the sequential (on-line) outlier detection schemes, that are based on the `delete-replace' approach. We also demonstrate that three different types of residuals can be used to design the outlier detection scheme to achieve accurate sequential estimation: marginal residual, conditional residual, and contribution.},

To tackle large-scale data, several online techniques for NMF have been introduced recently. So far, the online NMF has been limited to the linear model. This paper develops an online version of the nonlinear kernel-based NMF, where the decomposition is performed in the feature space. Taking the advantage of the stochastic gradient descent and the mini-batch scheme, the proposed method has a fixed, tractable complexity independent of the increasing samples number.

A Student's-t distribution is employed to improve the robustness of the filters whose tail is heavier than the Gaussian distribution and thus has the potential to cover more widely-spread particles. The OCSVM is trained based on both colour and oriented gradient (HOG) histogram features and then used to mitigate the measurement noise from the particle selection step, thereby improve the tracking performance. To evaluate the proposed PHD filter, we employed two sequences from the CAVIAR dataset and used the optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) method as an objective measure.

In this work, we introduce such a methodology in the context of Gene Regulatory Network inference. These networks are useful to visualize gene interactions occurring in living organisms: some genes regulate the expression of others, structuring the network into modules where they play a central role.

This paper considers some properties of the unitary transform-based template protection in particular. It is known that the Euclidean distance between the templates protected by a unitary transform is the same as that between original (non-protected) ones as a property. In this paper, moreover, it is shown that it provides the same results in l2-norm minimization problems as those of original templates. This means that there is no degradation of recognition performance in authentication systems using l2-norm minimization. Therefore, the protected templates can be reissued multiple times without original templates. In addition, a DFT-based template protection scheme is proposed as an unitary transform-based one. The proposed scheme enables to efficiently generate protected templates by the FFT, in addition to the useful properties. It is also applied to face recognition experiments to evaluate the effectiveness.},

Three degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wrist including flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and pronation-supination were used. We first classify feature vectors extracted from the EMG signals into three classes namely positive output, negative output and dead zone output, using a multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. Then for each DoF and each class, a neural network was trained to associate EMG features to their corresponding force outputs. We will show that this classification prior to regression plays an important role in increasing the performance of force estimation. The accuracy of estimation ranges from 90% to 94% (R2 index) in 8 able-bodied subjects, which is proved to be significantly higher (p<;0.05) than that of the previous works.},

  abstract = {The electrical activity signals in plants can provide useful information to monitor environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pollution. Nonetheless the study of the relationship between environmental stimuli and electrical responses of plants is still a critical step in developing technologies that use plants as organic sensing devices. In this paper an automatic method of analysis of plant electrical signals for ozone critical levels detection is proposed, based on the fundamentals of correlation theory. In order to classify the morphology characteristics of plant response to ozone exposure we used a segmentation of time series measurements of the electrical activity of plants before, during and after the stimulation.

Semi-static multicell cooperation exploits multiple predefined base station (BS) cluster patterns for improving cell-edge user throughput. The proposed clustering guarantees that every user communicates with their two closest BSs, so that users are protected from the dominant interferer. The key idea of the proposed clustering is to use the 2nd-order Voronoi region to form BS clusters. Each of the formed BS clusters is mapped into a particular cluster pattern by exploiting the edge-coloring in graph theory. Through simulations, the performance is compared to that of other conventional strategies. Our major finding is that the proposed clustering provides performance gains for cell-edge users compared to that of the conventional strategies.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a system-level performance comparison of two fundamentally different transmission strategies for the downlink of a cloud radio access network. The two strategies, namely the data-sharing strategy and the compression-based strategy, differ in the way the limited backhaul is utilized. While the data-sharing strategy uses the backhaul to carry raw user data, the compression strategy uses the backhaul to carry compressed beamformed signals. Although these strategies have been individually studied in the literature, a fair comparison of the two schemes under practical network settings is challenging because of the complexity in jointly optimizing user scheduling, beamforming, and power control for system-level performance evaluation, along with the need to optimize cooperation clusters for the data-sharing strategy and quantization noise levels for the compression strategy. This paper presents an optimization framework for both the data-sharing and compression strategies, while taking into account losses due to practical modulation in terms of gap to capacity and practical quantization in terms of gap to rate-distortion limit. The main conclusion of this paper is that the compression-based strategy, even with a simple fixed-rate uniform quantizer, outperforms the data-sharing strategy under medium to high capacity backhauls. However, the data-sharing strategy outperforms the compression strategy under low capacity backhauls primarily because of the large quantization loss at low backhaul capacity with compression.},

When applied for dereverberation, however, the adaptation process results in a biased estimate of the beamformer coefficients leading to strong distortions at the beamformer output. In this paper, we investigate the origin of this bias for the generalized sidelobe canceller. It is shown that an unbiased estimate of the beam-former coefficients and thus dereverberation can be achieved if the source signal is a white random signal. Based on these findings, a pre-whitening approach for speech signals is proposed and combined with a generalized sidelobe canceller for speech dereverberation. The concept is demonstrated for the case of stationary speech-shaped noise as a source signal.},

We address the reconstruction of basic sound ields (room-modes) using linear loudspeaker array conigurations.

  year = {2015},
  pages = {2481-2485},
  abstract = {In many single- and multi-channel speech dereverberation methods an estimate of the late reverberant spectral variance (LRSV) is required. Contrary to LRSV estimators based on room acoustical properties, such as reverberation time, or based on isotropic models of the reverberant sound field, in this paper we propose to use acoustic channel equalization with estimated room impulse responses (RIRs) for LRSV estimation. Unlike the typical application of acoustic channel equalization, where the objective is to estimate the anechoic or the early reverberant speech component, here the late reverberant part of the estimated RIR is set as the target response. The combination of the proposed LRSV estimator with a beamformer and a spectral gain aims at a tradeoff between the performance of acoustic channel equalization and the robustness of methods based on models of the reverberant sound field. The performance, evaluated for different levels of RIR estimation error, is compared to the results obtained using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the LRSV, based on an isotropic model of the reverberant sound field, and to a state-of-the-art acoustic channel equalization method. Experimental results for different acoustic scenarios show that for medium levels of RIR estimation errors the proposed method outperforms acoustic channel equalization as well as the maximum-likelihood LRSV estimator in terms of instrumental speech quality measures.},

The compromise between computational efficiency and data fidelity is then investigated, and finally the relevance of the approach is demonstrated on a problem of brain source localization using simulated magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.},

  abstract = {We propose a general algorithmic framework for constrained matrix and tensor factorization, which is widely used in unsupervised learning. The new framework is a hybrid between alternating optimization (AO) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): each matrix factor is updated in turn, using ADMM. This combination can naturally accommodate a great variety of constraints on the factor matrices, hence the term `universal'. Computation caching and warm start strategies are used to ensure that each update is evaluated efficiently, while the outer AO framework guarantees that the algorithm converges monotonically. Simulations on synthetic data show significantly improved performance relative to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {We propose a continuous measurement technique which can be used to capture a large number of impulse responses within short time. The response of an acoustic system is continuously captured by a moving microphone, and the instantaneous impulse responses are computed by post-processing. The time-variance due to the movement of the microphone is compensated by employing a recently proposed system identification method. In this method, each sample of the captured signal is interpreted as the orthogonal expansion coefficient of the instantaneous impulse response. The impulse responses are computed from the interpolated orthogonal coefficients. This method is applied to the measurement on a circle. Based on the modal bandwidth of the spatio-temporal impulse response, the relation among the length of the impulse response, the angular speed of the microphone, and the effective number of measurements is revealed. The presented measurement technique was used to measure a large number of room impulse responses, and the results were compared with a conventional sequential measurement technique.},

We present in this paper an improved model based on the idea of audio phrases which are sequences of multiple audio words. By using audio phrases, we are able to capture the relationship between the isolated audio words and produce more semantic descriptors. Furthermore, we also propose an efficient approach to learn a compact codebook in a discriminative manner to deal with high-dimensionality of bag-of-audio-phrases representations.

Analysis of the atrial activity (AA) signal contained in electrocardiograms during AF episodes is a noninvasive and inexpensive solution for obtaining useful information about AF. This work presents tensor decompositions as an alternative to classic blind source separation methods based on matrix decompositions due to their appealing uniqueness properties and considers in particular the block term decomposition (BTD). The practical usefulness of BTD is evaluated by comparing its AA estimation quality, measured by spectral concentration, to those oftwo benchmark methods, revealing that BTD presents a better performance.

Conventional storage and transmission of large-scale raw medical image datasets can be very expensive and time-consuming. Recently, we proposed a memory-assisted lossless image compression algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis(PCA). In this paper, we further improve the performance of the algorithm in two different directions: Firstly, we replace PC A with NMF (Non Negative Matrix Factorization). NMF has several advantages in representing images with an image-like basis, results in sparse factors, and provides better user control over iterations. Secondly, we expand the single-level model with a new multilevel decomposition/projection framework to further reduce entropy of residual images. Our experimental results on X-ray images confirm that both modifications provide significant improvements over the single level PCA based algorithm as well as existing non-memory based techniques.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the design of a novel high-energy concentration kernel quadratic TFD for EEG spike signal analysis is presented. Firstly, we show that the suppression of the negative frequency of the signal due of the use of Hilbert transform causes low Time-Frequency Distribution (TFD) resolution in the very low frequency band. To remedy this artifact, a frequency shifting of the signal to the mid frequency band is used so that the negative and positive frequencies are taken into account in the time-frequency domain. This process enhances the TFD resolution in the very low frequency band. Secondly, we derived a new separable kernel TFD with a high auto-terms energy concentration based on the localization of the auto-terms and cross-terms of the EEG spike signal in the ambiguity domain. The proposed kernel uses only two parameters and offers high TFD resolution compared to the existing ones.},

We analyse the effect of Gaussian random snapshot (OFDM symbol) timing jitter on the spatio-frequency sample covariance matrix containing delay and direction information. This sample covariance matrix is an input to the JADE and many other algorithms for signal parameter estimation. The analysis suggests a simple way to compensate for the jitter in the sample covariance matrix. We also present two simple methods for estimating the jitter variance, allowing its compensation. These techniques attempt to restore the low rank nature or other structure in the signal contribution. We then finally present some simulations for the resulting estimation quality of the multipath delays (ToAs) and angles (AoAs) of the incoming signals.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new robust and low computationally algorithm is proposed for broadband geolocalization. Recent work have demonstrated the superiority of the geolocalization in 1-step over the 2-steps algorithms. However this superiority is obtained at the price of a bandwidth slicing which is unfortunately limited for computational reasons and leads to an asymptotic bias due to the residual broadband effect. This paper we propose an alternative approach fully exploiting the total bandwidth and consequently suppressing the slicing drawbacks. The proposed method is named TARGET and exploits the rank deficiency of a temporal shift dependent covariance matrix after a multichannel synchronization. Our analysis and simulations prove the performance advantage of proposed method over recently introduced ones.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a Track Before Detect (TBD) filter for Direction Of Arrival (DOA) tracking of multiple targets from phased-array observations. The phased-array model poses a new problem since each target emits a signal, called source signal. Existing methods consider the source signal as part of the system state. This is inefficient, especially for particle approximations of posteriors, where samples are drawn from the higher-dimensional posterior of the extended state. To address this problem, we propose a novel Marked Poisson Point Process (MPPP) model and derive the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter that adaptively estimates target DOAs. The PPP models variations of both the number and the location of points representing targets. The mark of a point represents the source signal, without the need of an extended state. Recursive formulas for the MPPP PHD filter are derived with simulations showcasing improved performance over state-of-the art methods.},

Then, a beamspace matrix is adaptively designed for each subarray, such that the beampatterns corresponding to each matrix have the exact same magnitude.

In this paper we extend the well-known Real-Time Compressive Tracking algorithm to automatically determine the location of dairy and beef cows from multiple video cameras in the pen. Several optimisations are introduced to improve algorithm accuracy. An automatic approach for updating the bounding box which discourages the algorithm from learning the background is presented. We also dynamically weight the location estimates from multiple cameras using boosting to avoid errors introduced by occlusion and by the tracked animal moving in and out of the field of view.},

This paper present a novel algorithm for HR estimation from PPG signal based on motion artifact removal (MAR) and adaptive tracking (AT) that overcomes limitations of the previous techniques.

The selection of optimal subsets has been addressed through several variable or feature selection methods including genetic algorithms. Some of them are not adapted on large data, others require additional information such as concentrations or are difficult to tune.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel structure for implementing a kernel adaptive filter as an add-on component for a linear adaptive filter. The kernel adaptive filter has been proposed as a solution to non-linear adaptive problems and their effectiveness has been demonstrated. However, it is not intended for replacing the linear adaptive filters at all, rather, we expect it to complement the performance of linear ones in nonlinear environments. We, therefore, consider a novel structure which enables us to implement a kernel adaptive filter as an add-on for a linear adaptive filter. The proposed structure performs as a linear adaptive filter in the linear-dominant environments, however, in non-linear environments, we can add a kernel adaptive filter without any modification on the operation of the linear one. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through the computer simulations.},

We specialize the result to the mixture Kalman filter, verifying that the exact solution is available in this case. This allows us to consider the quality of the SF-based approximate solution.

Indeed, averaging EEG signal covariance matrices is a key step in designing brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on the popular common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. BCI paradigms are typically structured into trials and we argue that this structure should be taken into account. Moreover, the non-Euclidean structure of covariance matrices should be taken into consideration as well. We review several approaches from the literature for averaging covariance matrices in CSP and compare them empirically on three publicly available datasets. Our results show that using Riemannian geometry for averaging covariance matrices improves performances for small dimensional problems, but also the limits of this approach when the dimensionality increases.},

Existing regression or independent component analysis based artefacts correction methods are usually not applicable when EOG is not available or when there are very few EEG channels. In this paper, we propose a novel ocular artefacts correction method for processing EEG without using dedicated EOG channels. The method constructs estimate of ocular components through artefacts detection in EEG. Then, an optimization based on logistic regression is introduced to remove the components from EEG. Specifically, the optimization ensures that the discriminative information is maintained in the corrected EEG signals. The proposed method is offline evaluated with a large EEG data set containing 68 subjects. Experimental results show that, through the artefacts removal correction by the proposed method, EEG classification accuracy can be improved with statistical significance.},

  abstract = {Deep learning, recently, has been successfully applied to image classification, object recognition and speech recognition. However, the benefits of deep learning and accompanying architectures have been largely unknown for BCI applications. In motor imagery-based BCI, an energy-based feature, typically after spatial filtering, is commonly used for classification. Although this feature corresponds to the estimate of event-related synchronization/desynchronization in the brain, it neglects energy dynamics which may contain valuable discriminative information. Because traditional classiication methods, such as SVM, cannot handle this dynamical property, we proposed an architecture that inputs a dynamic energy representation of EEG data and utilizes convolutional neural networks for classification. By combining this network with a static energy network, we saw a significant increase in performance. We evaluated the proposed method and compared with SVM on a multi-class motor imagery dataset (BCI competition dataset IV-2a). Our method outperforms SVM with static energy features significantly (p <; 0.01).},

  abstract = {Although the field of Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) has made incredible advances in the last decade, current BCIs are still scarcely used outside laboratories. One reason is the lack of robustness to noise, artifacts and nonstationarity which are intrinsic parts of the recorded brain signal. Furthermore out-of-lab environments imply the presence of external variables that are largely beyond the control of the user, but can severely corrupt signal quality. This paper presents a new generation of robust EEG signal processing approaches based on the information geometric notion of divergence. We show that these divergence-based methods can be used for robust spatial filtering and thus increase the systems' reliability when confronted to, e.g., environmental noise, users' motions or electrode artifacts. Furthermore we extend the divergence-based framework to heavy-tail distributions and investigate the advantages of a joint optimization for robustness and stationarity.},

However, the transmit power is limited in practical wireless communication systems. The high order modulation and low code rate is restrictively used.

For that purpose, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric model based on the Markov Indian buffet process and an inference algorithm that makes use of slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively recover the data-generating process for a wide range of scenarios.},

Our stochastic extension for handling large data sets is closely related to stochastic variational inference, with the stochastic update for one parameter exactly that found using SVI.

The proposed CS message passing approaches have been tested on simulated CT data using the BM3D denoiser [2] yielding an improvement in the reconstruction quality compared to existing direct and iterative methods.

In the former case we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for full spark, and show that lines with integer slopes cannot attain it.},

A variety of bounds on the error introduced by such non ideal sampling schemes are computed by considering a statistical model for the perturbations. They indicate that coprime sampling leads to stable estimation of the autocorrelation sequence, in presence of small perturbations. Additional results on identifiability in spatial spectrum estimation are derived using the Fisher Information Matrix, which indicate that with high probability, it is still possible to identify O(M2) sources with M sensors, with a perturbed coprime array.},

  abstract = {Angular resolution can be improved by using co-prime arrays instead of uniform linear arrays (ULA) with the same number of elements. We investigate how the possible co-prime angle resolution is related to the angle resolution from a full ULA of the size equal to the virtual size of co-prime arrays. We take into account not only the resulting beam width but also the fact that fewer measurements are acquired by co-prime arrays. This fact is especially relevant in compressive acquisition typical for compressive sensing. This angular resolution is called angular information resolution as it is computed from the intrinsic geometrical structure of data models that is characterized by the Fisher information. Based on this information-geometry approach, we compare angular information resolution from co-prime arrays and from the two ULAs. This novel resolution analysis is applied in a one-dimensional azimuth case. Numerical results demonstrate the suitability in radar-resolution analysis.},

It is based on the BM3D (Block-Matching and 3D filtering) paradigm, where both sparsity and nonlocal patch self-similarity priors are utilized. The algorithm is derived from a variational formulation of the problem and has a structure typical for iterative back-projection super-resolution methods. They are characterized by updating high-resolution image which is calculated using the previous estimate and upsampled low-resolution error. The developed method is thoroughly compared with the state-of-the-art SISR both for noiseless and noisy data, demonstrating superior performance objectively and subjectively.},

  abstract = {Food quality analysis is a key area where reliable, nondestructive and accurate measures are required. Hyperspectral imaging is a technology which meets all of these requirements but only if appropriate signal processing techniques are implemented. In this paper, a discussion of some of these state-of-the-art processing techniques is followed by an explanation of four different applications of hyperspectral imaging for food quality analysis: shelf life estimation of baked sponges; beef quality prediction; classification of Chinese tea leaves; and classification of rice grains. The first two of these topics investigate the use of hyperspectral imaging to produce an objective measure about the quality of the food sample. The final two studies are classification problems, where an unknown sample is assigned to one of a previously defined set of classes.},

  year = {2015},
  pages = {2859-2863},
  abstract = {While compressive sensing (CS) has traditionally relied on l2 as an error norm, a broad spectrum of applications has emerged where robust estimators are required. Among those, applications where the sampling process is performed in the presence of impulsive noise, or where the sampling of the high-dimensional sparse signals requires the preservation of a distance different than l2. This article overviews robust sampling and nonlinear reconstruction strategies for sparse signals based on the Cauchy distribution and the Lorentzian norm for the data fidelity. The derived methods outperform existing compressed sensing techniques in impulsive environments, thus offering a robust framework for CS.},

  abstract = {In recent years the virtual restoration of ancient papyri has become an important research challenge. This is because the papyrus degradation is often very serious, so physical analysis could damage the artifact. In this paper we address the problem of virtual unrolling to read papyrus scroll by avoiding a dangerous physical unrolling. To this aim we propose a virtual restoration method based on software manipulation of X-ray tomographic images. To test the proposed approach, a realistic papyrus model has been made using the ancient method and pigments compatible with the Egyptian use. The stack of 259 slices, obtained through X-Ray Tomography device, has been processed in order to obtain a digital unrolled papyrus that is quite similar to the hypothetical unrolled sheet.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a functional link-based architecture that separates the linear and nonlinear filterings and exploits any sparse representation of functional links. We focus our attention on the nonlinear path in order to improve the modeling performance of the overall architecture. To this end, we propose a new scheme that involves the adaptive combination of filters downstream of the nonlinear expansion. This combination enhances the sparse representation of functional links according to how much distorted the input signal is, thus improving the nonlinear modeling performance in case of time-varying nonlinear systems. Experimental results show the performance improvement produced by the proposed model.},

  pages = {2874-2878},
  abstract = {The paper deals with the task of robust nonlinear regression in the presence of outliers. The problem is dealt in the context of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In contrast to more classical approaches, a recent trend is to model the outliers as a sparse vector noise component and mobilize tools from the sparsity-aware/compressed sensing theory to impose sparsity on it. In this paper, three of the most popular approaches are considered and compared. These represent three major directions in sparsity-aware learning context; that is, a) a greedy approach b) a convex relaxation of the sparsity-promoting task via the l\ norm-based regularization of the least-squares cost and c) a Bayesian approach making use of appropriate priors, associated with the involved parameters.},
